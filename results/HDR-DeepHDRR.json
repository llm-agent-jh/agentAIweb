    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance blurry outdoor event photos by applying HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing to create a sunlight-enhanced appearance. The task involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Deblurring**: Removing motion blur or focus blur from outdoor event photos\n- **HDR Enhancement**: Converting standard photos to HDR with enhanced sunlight characteristics (improved dynamic range, enhanced highlights, and realistic lighting)\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes blurry outdoor photos through a branching neural network where the input image flows through two parallel enhancement paths that later merge. The input photo first gets analyzed for blur characteristics, then branches into: (1) a deblurring path using low-light enhancement techniques, and (2) an atmospheric correction path using dehazing methods to prepare for HDR processing. These enhanced outputs then converge into the HDR conversion module, which applies dynamic range expansion and sunlight enhancement. The system uses feedback loops where the HDR module can request re-processing if the initial enhancement quality is insufficient.\n\n### B.

Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input**: Raw blurry outdoor photos (RGB format)\n- **Function**: Deblurs images while enhancing low-light regions common in outdoor events\n- **Output**: Deblurred images with improved clarity and reduced noise\n- **Intermediate Format**: Enhanced RGB images with preserved color information\n\n**Module 2: WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze**\n- **Input**: Same raw blurry photos (parallel processing)\n- **Function**: Removes atmospheric haze and weather-related blur that affects outdoor photos\n- **Output**: Atmospherically corrected images with improved contrast\n- **Intermediate Format**: Dehazed RGB images with enhanced visibility\n\n**Module 3: Image Fusion**\n- **Input**: Outputs from both enhancement modules\n- **Function**: Intelligently combines deblurred and dehazed versions\n- **Output**: Optimally enhanced base image ready for HDR processing\n- **Intermediate Format**: Fused RGB image with optimal clarity and atmospheric correction\n\n**Module 4: HDR-DeepHDRR**\n- **Input**: Fused enhanced image\n- **Function**: Converts to HDR with sunlight enhancement using deep learning-based tone mapping\n- **Output**: HDR image with enhanced dynamic range and sunlight characteristics\n- **Final Format**: HDR image with realistic sunlight feel and expanded dynamic range\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture is justified by the complementary nature of the available models:\n\n**Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** addresses the blur component by enhancing image clarity, particularly useful for outdoor events where lighting conditions may contribute to blur.\n\n**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** handles atmospheric factors that commonly affect outdoor photography, preparing the image for optimal HDR processing by removing haze that could interfere with dynamic range expansion.\n\n**HDR-DeepHDRR** (referenced in the SIGGRAPH 2020 paper: https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/Papers/SIGGRAPH2020_HDR/files/SIGGRAPH2020Final.pdf) provides the core HDR conversion capability. The paper demonstrates deep learning approaches for HDR reconstruction that can create realistic sunlight effects and expanded dynamic range from standard images.\n\nThe branching architecture allows parallel processing of different image degradation factors (blur and atmospheric effects) before combining them for optimal HDR enhancement, creating a synapse-like network where each module contributes specialized processing that enhances the final HDR sunlight effect.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user's main objective is to transform outdoor event photos that are currently blurry into high-quality HDR images with a \"sunlight feel.\" This involves several sub-goals:\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- **Deblurring & Dehazing:** Enhance clarity by removing atmospheric haze and blurriness.\n- **HDR Conversion:** Increase dynamic range to recover detail in bright and dark regions.\n- **Sunlight Emulation:** Apply visual adjustments to mimic the effect of bright daylight.\n- **Content Preservation:** Maintain the structure and semantics of the original image.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe input image is fed simultaneously into two specialized branches:\n1. **Branch A (Atmospheric Enhancement):** Uses `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` to dehaze and sharpen the image, increasing clarity and color saturation.\n2. **Branch B (HDR Recovery):** Uses `HDR-DeepHDRR` to reconstruct HDR data from the LDR image, restoring details in shadows and highlights.\n\nAt the **Synaptic Merge Node**, outputs from both branches are combined. Luminance from the HDR path is fused with chrominance (color) from the dehazed image to produce a vibrant and high-detail image. The result is tone-mapped for display.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and Design Rationale**\n\n- `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` is ideal for Branch A to resolve haze-related blurriness and enhance daylight characteristics.\n- `HDR-DeepHDRR` is selected for Branch B to convert LDR input to HDR. This is critical for enhancing image realism and detail under strong lighting conditions ([Paper Link](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/Papers/SIGGRAPH2020_HDR/files/SIGGRAPH2020Final.pdf)).\n- The **merge strategy** uses luminance from the HDR branch and chrominance from the DeHaze branch, a proven approach in image processing.\n- `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` is excluded since the task relates to outdoor daylight, not low-light scenes.\n\n---",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to transform a single, blurry outdoor photograph into a sharp, high-quality image that appears to have been taken in bright sunlight. This involves correcting for atmospheric distortion and expanding the image's dynamic range.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring & Dehazing:** Remove the blurriness, which is likely caused by atmospheric haze in an outdoor setting.\n*   **Dynamic Range Expansion:** Convert the Low Dynamic Range (LDR) source into a High Dynamic Range (HDR) image to recover detail in shadows and highlights.\n*   **Atmospheric Emulation:** Achieve a \"sunlight feel\" through enhanced vibrancy, clarity, and contrast, characteristic of a bright, clear day.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Ensure the original composition and key elements of the photograph remain intact and are not distorted.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network with two parallel processing branches that specialize in different aspects of the user's request. The outputs of these branches are then intelligently merged at a synaptic node to produce a final, superior result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's single blurry outdoor photo as input. This input is simultaneously routed to two specialized processing branches:\n\n1.  **The Atmosphere Branch:** This path uses the `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` model. Its sole purpose is to address the \"blurry\" and \"sunlight feel\" aspects by removing atmospheric haze. This process significantly improves local contrast, color saturation, and perceived sharpness, creating a clear and vibrant version of the image.\n2.  **The Dynamic Range Branch:** This path uses the `HDR-DeepHDRR` model. Its purpose is to fulfill the explicit \"change to HDR\" request. It analyzes the single input image and reconstructs a true HDR version, recovering immense detail from the over-exposed (sky) and under-exposed (shadow) regions.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches—a clear, vibrant LDR image and a detail-rich HDR image—converge at a **Synaptic Merge Node**. Here, the system combines the best attributes of both. It takes the superior luminance (brightness and contrast detail) from the HDR output and merges it with the superior chrominance (color and saturation) from the de-hazed output.\n\nFinally, this merged HDR result is tone-mapped into a standard image format (like JPEG) that is viewable on a normal screen, delivering the final enhanced photo to the user.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and Design Rationale**\n\nThis CNAPS design is specifically tailored to the user's request and the provided tools.\n\n*   **Model Selection and Branching:**\n    *   **`WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`:** This model is chosen for **Branch A** because the user's description of a \"blurry\" outdoor photo strongly implies the presence of atmospheric haze. Haze scatters light, reducing sharpness and vibrancy. Removing it is the most direct way to achieve the \"sunlight feel\" by restoring clarity and color.\n    *   **`HDR-DeepHDRR`:** This model is the cornerstone of **Branch B**. The user explicitly asked for \"HDR.\" The associated paper ([SIGGRAPH 2020](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/nimak/Papers/SIGGRAPH2020_HDR/files/SIGGRAPH2020Final.pdf)) confirms that this model excels at reconstructing a full HDR image from a *single LDR input*, which is precisely our use case. It is the ideal tool for recovering lost details in the brightest and darkest parts of the scene.\n\n*   **Synaptic Merge Rationale:**\n    A simple linear pipeline (e.g., DeHaze -> HDR) would be less effective. The DeHaze model might alter the image in ways that hinder the HDR reconstruction, or vice-versa. The parallel, synaptic approach allows each model to perform its specialized task on the original data, maximizing its effectiveness. The **Luminance/Chrominance Fusion** at the merge node is a standard and powerful technique in image processing. It leverages the fact that `DeepHDRR` produces the best luminance information (dynamic range), while `CLAIO-DeHaze` produces the best chrominance information (vibrant, clear colors). Combining them creates a result that is superior to the output of either model alone.\n\n*   **Excluded Model:**\n    *   **`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`:** This model was intentionally **excluded**. The user's goal of a \"sunlight feel\" is the diametric opposite of a low-light scenario. Applying a low-light enhancer would likely introduce unwanted noise and artifacts, working directly against the desired outcome. This highlights the importance of routing tasks to the correct specialized modules in a CNAPS architecture."
