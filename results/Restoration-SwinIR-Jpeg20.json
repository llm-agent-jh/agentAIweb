    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a compressed and blurred scanned document image to make the letters and lines clear and readable. This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **JPEG compression artifact removal** to eliminate blocking artifacts and restore image quality\n- **Deblurring** to sharpen blurred text and line elements while preserving document structure\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system receives a compressed, blurred document image and routes it through a **parallel branching network** where specialized restoration modules work simultaneously. The input branches into two parallel paths: one focused on JPEG compression artifact removal using SwinIR models, and another focused on motion/blur removal using MSSNet. These paths process the image independently, then their outputs are intelligently merged through a weighted combination strategy that preserves the strengths of each restoration approach. The system can adaptively choose between different compression restoration levels based on the severity of artifacts detected.\n\n### B.

Module Details\n\n**Input Module:**\n- **Input:** Compressed, blurred document image (RGB/Grayscale)\n- **Output:** Preprocessed image + quality metrics\n\n**JPEG Restoration Branch:**\n- **Restoration-SwinIR-Jpeg30:** Handles moderate compression artifacts (Quality ~30)\n- **Restoration-SwinIR-Jpeg40:** Handles severe compression artifacts (Quality ~40)\n- **Selection Logic:** Chooses model based on detected compression level\n- **Output:** Artifact-free document image\n\n**Deblur Branch:**\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR:** Removes motion blur and focus blur from real-world scenarios\n- **Output:** Sharp, deblurred document image\n\n**Adaptive Merger:**\n- **Function:** Intelligently combines JPEG-restored and deblurred results\n- **Strategy:** Weighted fusion based on local image quality metrics\n- **Output:** Final enhanced document with clear letters and lines\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design is optimal because:\n\n1. **SwinIR models** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10257) are specifically designed for image restoration tasks and excel at removing JPEG compression artifacts while preserving fine details crucial for text readability.\n\n2. **MSSNet** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) specializes in real-world blur removal, making it ideal for handling the motion blur and focus issues common in scanned documents.\n\n3. **Parallel processing** allows both restoration tasks to occur simultaneously, reducing overall processing time while maintaining quality.\n\n4. **Adaptive model selection** between Jpeg30 and Jpeg40 variants ensures optimal restoration based on compression severity.\n\n5. **Synaptic merging** combines the strengths of both restoration approaches, as document images often suffer from both compression and blur simultaneously.\n\nThis branching architecture mirrors biological neural networks where specialized modules process different aspects of the same input before integration, making it a true CNAPS implementation for document restoration."
