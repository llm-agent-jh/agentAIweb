    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform **4x super-resolution enhancement** on a blurry outdoor food stall photograph, with specific emphasis on improving lighting conditions and cooking scene clarity. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation of food stall elements and cooking equipment\n- Texture realism for food items and cooking surfaces\n- Lighting enhancement to reveal details in potentially dim outdoor conditions\n- Detail recovery for cooking scenes and food preparation activities\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synapse network** where the input image flows through two specialized enhancement pathways that process different aspects simultaneously. The **Structure Branch** handles super-resolution scaling using transformer-based attention mechanisms, while the **Illumination Branch** processes lighting enhancement. Both branches operate in parallel initially, then merge through a **feature fusion synapse** that combines structural detail recovery with lighting optimization. The system includes a **quality assessment feedback loop** that can trigger re-processing if the merged output doesn't meet clarity thresholds for the cooking scene areas.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synapse architecture** is specifically designed for the user's dual requirements:\n\n1. **Swin2SR-Classical-4x** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345) provides state-of-the-art super-resolution through shifted window attention mechanisms, ideal for preserving food stall structural details while achieving 4x scaling.\n\n2. **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** addresses the outdoor lighting challenges mentioned by the user, ensuring cooking scenes become clearly visible.\n\n3. The **branching synapse design** allows parallel processing of different enhancement aspects, then intelligently merges them rather than applying them sequentially, which could compound artifacts.\n\n4. The **feedback loop** ensures cooking scene clarity meets user expectations, providing adaptive refinement capability typical of biological neural networks.\n\nThis architecture leverages the complementary strengths of both models while maintaining the synapse-like branching and merging characteristics that define CNAPS systems.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is routed into a dual-branch synaptic system. The **Illumination Branch** uses `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` to correct for poor lighting and improve visibility in dark regions. In parallel, the **Structure Branch** applies `SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x`, a Swin Transformer-based model, to perform 4× super-resolution focused on preserving structural detail.

Justification\n\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** improves visibility in shadowed or unevenly lit outdoor environments. This ensures that fine cooking scene details are recoverable prior to scaling【577†source】.\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** is a Swin Transformer-based super-resolution model that provides long-range attention and hierarchical structure preservation. Ideal for scenes with complex textures like food, cookware, and signage【577†source】.\n- The **Fusion Module** ensures lighting corrections do not override the high-resolution structural gains, maintaining photorealism.\n\nThis branching CNAPS system aligns with neuro-inspired processing: one branch for illumination, one for structure, both fused to produce perceptually optimized 4× enlarged output.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a single, blurry photograph of an outdoor food stall. This involves a 4x super-resolution to increase its size and detail, combined with a low-light enhancement to correct the lighting and clarify the cooking scenes.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Super-Resolution:** Enlarge the image by a factor of 4.\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** Improve brightness, contrast, and color fidelity, making details in dark areas visible.\n*   **Detail & Texture Restoration:** Ensure that crucial elements like cooking utensils, food textures, and ambient light sources are rendered clearly and realistically in the final, enlarged image.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network with a conditional path and a primary parallel-processing branch. It intelligently handles the dual challenges of low light and low resolution by first correcting the lighting information and then feeding that improved data into two specialized super-resolution models simultaneously.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins by ingesting the single, blurry input image.\n\n1.  **Conditional Pre-processing:** The system first performs a pre-analysis to determine if the image is indeed low-light. If it is, the image is routed to a specialized enhancement module. If the lighting is already adequate, this step is bypassed to prevent over-exposure artifacts. This conditional routing is the first \"synaptic\" decision point.\n\n2.  **Enhancement:** The `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` module processes the image, correcting brightness and revealing details hidden in the shadows. This step is critical because attempting to upscale a dark image would amplify noise and artifacts. By enhancing first, we provide the subsequent super-resolution models with a much cleaner, more informative low-resolution source.\n\n3.  **Parallel Branching (The Synapse):** After enhancement, the improved low-resolution image is duplicated and sent down two parallel branches simultaneously. This is the core of the CNAPS design.\n    *   **Branch A (High-Fidelity Path):** The image is sent to the `SISR-Swin2SR` model. This Transformer-based model excels at reconstructing complex textures and long-range dependencies, making it ideal for the intricate details of a \"cooking scene.\"\n    *   **Branch B (Lightweight Path):** The image is also sent to the `SISR-IMDN` model. This lightweight CNN-based model provides a very fast and efficient alternative. It may produce a slightly different aesthetic, which could be preferable depending on the specific image content.\n\n4.  **Output Aggregation:** The workflow does not automatically merge the two outputs. Instead, it presents both the high-fidelity `Swin2SR` result and the lightweight `IMDN` result to the user. This allows the user to make the final subjective choice, as one model may have rendered the lighting better while the other captured the food texture more accurately.\n\nThe final output is a pair of 4x upscaled and enhanced images, each offering a different high-quality restoration.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis workflow is meticulously designed based on the capabilities of the provided models and the principles of image restoration.\n\n1.  **Enhance First, Then Upscale:** The decision to place the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` module *before* the super-resolution models is critical. Upscaling a dark image would mean the SR models have to \"guess\" details from noisy, low-information pixels, leading to blotchy and artifact-ridden results. By enhancing the low-resolution image first, we restore crucial color and structural information, providing a high-quality input for the SR models to work with.\n\n2.  **Conditional Enhancement:** The initial pre-analysis step prevents the workflow from applying low-light enhancement to an already well-lit photo, which could cause blown-out highlights and an unnatural look. This makes the system more robust and autonomous.\n\n3.  **Justification for Parallel Branching (CNAPS Core):** A simple linear pipeline is insufficient because different SR architectures have distinct strengths. By branching the workflow, we leverage the unique advantages of both provided SR models.\n    *   **Branch A: `SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x` (High-Fidelity):** The paper for this model, *Swin2SR: SwinV2 Transformer for Compressed Image Super-Resolution and Restoration* ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)), highlights its foundation in the SwinV2 Transformer. Transformers are exceptionally good at modeling long-range dependencies, making this model the prime candidate for restoring the complex and varied textures of a \"cooking scene\"—from the metallic sheen of a wok to the subtle gradients of steam and the intricate details of food. This is our \"quality-first\" path.\n    *   **Branch B: `SISR-IMDN-4x` (Lightweight):** The paper for this model, *Lightweight Image Super-Resolution with Information Multi-distillation Network* ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)), emphasizes its efficiency and lightweight architecture. While it may not capture global context as effectively as a Transformer, its CNN-based approach is extremely fast and can produce excellent results, sometimes with fewer of the \"hallucinated\" texture artifacts that larger models can create. This path provides a valid, high-speed alternative.\n\n4.  **Dual Output for User Choice:** Image quality is often subjective. One user might prefer the slightly sharper but potentially more \"processed\" look of Swin2SR, while"
