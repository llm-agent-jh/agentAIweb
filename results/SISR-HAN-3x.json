    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a blurry, distant sports photo by enlarging it 3x while simultaneously improving clarity** to make the athlete's movements visible. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Motion deblurring**: Removing blur caused by camera shake or subject movement\n- **Super-resolution upscaling**: Enlarging the image by 3x while preserving/enhancing details\n- **Detail preservation**: Maintaining structural integrity of the athlete's form and movements\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synaptic network** where the input image flows through parallel processing paths that address different aspects of the enhancement task. The **deblurring branch** focuses on motion blur removal using MSSNet, while a **super-resolution branch** would handle upscaling (though no SR model is provided in the context). These branches can operate independently initially, then merge their outputs through a **fusion module** that combines the deblurred features with upscaled details. The network includes **feedback loops** where early deblurring results can inform the upscaling process, and **conditional routing** based on blur severity assessment.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Blur Assessment**\n- Input: RGB image (H×W×3)\n- Output: Blur severity score (0-1), motion direction vector\n- Function: Determines optimal deblurring strategy\n\n**Module 2: Deblur Branch (MSSNet-RealBlurR)**\n- Input: Blurry image + blur parameters\n- Output: Deblurred image (same resolution)\n- Architecture: Multi-scale structure with spatial attention\n- Reference: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 3: Upscale Branch**\n- Input: Original or deblurred image\n- Output: 3x enlarged image\n- *Missing from provided models - would need ESRGAN, EDSR, or similar*\n\n**Module 4: Feature Fusion**\n- Input: Deblurred features + upscaled features\n- Output: Combined feature maps\n- Function: Weighted fusion based on local quality metrics\n\n**Module 5: Quality Check & Feedback**\n- Input: Enhanced image\n- Output: Quality score + refinement parameters\n- Function: Iterative improvement through feedback loops\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\n**MSSNet Selection**: The MSSNet-RealBlurR model is specifically chosen over MSSNet-GoPro because it's trained on realistic blur patterns that better match sports photography scenarios where camera shake and subject motion create complex blur kernels (as detailed in the MSSNet paper: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf).\n\n**Synaptic Architecture Benefits**: The branching design allows **parallel processing** of deblurring and upscaling, reducing computational time while enabling **cross-branch information sharing**. The feedback loops ensure **iterative refinement** where initial deblurring results can inform better upscaling strategies.\n\n**Limitation**: The provided model set lacks a super-resolution component, which is critical for the 3x enlargement requirement. The workflow design accommodates this missing piece but would require integration of models like ESRGAN or Real-ESRGAN for complete functionality.\n\nThe enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer is not utilized as the user's request focuses on blur/resolution rather than lighting conditions.",
    "llm_b": "As an AI scientist designing a CNAPS-style synaptic workflow, I will construct a multi-module architecture that meets the user's goal: to enlarge a blurry photo of a runner by 3x while making the runner’s movements clearly visible.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user's goal is to produce a 3x enlarged version of the original photo, focusing on the **clarity and motion visibility of the distant runner**.  \nThis involves:\n- **Super-resolution** (image upscaling)\n- **Targeted deblurring** of the athlete (motion blur)\n- **Foreground-background separation**\n- **Visual realism and seamless composition**\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow mimics biological synaptic networks by branching into two paths: foreground and background. The two parts are processed independently and then merged seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nUpon receiving the blurry sports field photo, we first **detect and segment the runner** using a two-stage approach: `YOLOS` (bounding box) and `Segmentation-m2fp` (pixel mask). The mask splits the workflow:\n\n- **Foreground (Runner):**  \n  The cropped runner is deblurred using `Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro` (specialized in motion blur) and then upscaled 3x with `Super-Resolution-Real-ESRGAN`.\n\n- **Background (Field):**  \n  The background is isolated using the inverse mask and directly passed to `Super-Resolution-Real-ESRGAN`.\n\n- **Mask Path:**  \n  The mask itself is upscaled using nearest-neighbor interpolation to match the final resolution.\n\nFinally, a **compositing module** merges the processed foreground and background with edge blending for realism.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification\n\n- **CNAPS Justification:** A synaptic split ensures tailored processing per region (runner vs background), avoiding over-processing.\n- **Segmentation (`m2fp`)** allows precise isolation, per [Mask2Former](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527).\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro** is optimal for motion-blur scenarios [MSSNet PDF](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf).\n- **Real-ESRGAN** handles both realistic upscaling and artifact reduction.\n- **Mask Upscaling** ensures spatial alignment and smooth compositing.\n\nThis multi-branch CNAPS workflow provides high-quality output with minimal artifacts and sharp detail on the moving subject.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request, leveraging the provided models and papers.\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a photograph of a distant, blurry runner on a sports field. The primary goal is to **enlarge the image by 3x while simultaneously deblurring the athlete** to make their specific movements and form clearly visible.\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Super-Resolution:** Upscaling the entire image to 3x its original size.\n*   **Selective Deblurring:** Applying targeted deblurring to the runner, who is subject to motion blur, more so than the static background.\n*   **Subject-Background Separation:** Differentiating the runner (subject) from the sports field (background) to apply different enhancement techniques to each.\n*   **Natural Realism:** Ensuring the final, composited image looks coherent and natural, without obvious editing artifacts at the boundary between the enhanced runner and the background.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network. It begins with a \"sensory\" analysis phase that splits the input into distinct neural pathways (foreground and background). These pathways are processed in parallel by specialized modules and then recombined at a final \"synapse\" to produce the integrated output.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe workflow ingests the user's single, blurry photograph. Immediately, the image is routed into an **analysis branch** where two models work in concert: `Object-Detection-YOLOS` first identifies the bounding box of the \"person\" (the runner), and `Segmentation-m2fp` then generates a precise pixel-level mask of the runner within that box.\n\nThis mask acts as a switch, splitting the workflow into two parallel processing streams:\n\n1.  **The Foreground (Runner) Path:** The masked runner is isolated. Since the user wants to see \"movements clearly,\" this subject is likely suffering from motion blur. Therefore, it is first sent to the **`Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro`** model, which is specifically trained on datasets with significant motion blur. After deblurring, this sharp, clear version of the runner is passed to the **`Super-Resolution-Real-ESRGAN`** model to be upscaled by 3x.\n\n2.  **The Background (Field) Path:** The background of the sports field does not require the same intensive deblurring. Applying it could be computationally wasteful and might introduce unwanted artifacts. This path therefore bypasses the deblurring module and sends the original background directly to the **`Super-Resolution-Real-ESRGAN`** model for its 3x upscaling.\n\nFinally, the two paths converge at a **synaptic merge point**. The upscaled segmentation mask is used to composite the deblurred, upscaled runner onto the upscaled background. A slight feathering is applied to the mask's edge to ensure a seamless, natural blend.\n\nThe final output is a single, 3x larger image where the runner is sharp and detailed, while the background is cleanly upscaled, fulfilling the user's request.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design Choices\n\nThis CNAPS design is built on the principle of applying the right tool for the right sub-task, which is more efficient and effective than a simple linear pipeline.\n\n*   **Initial Analysis (`Segmentation-m2fp`, `Object-Detection-YOLOS`):** The user's focus is explicitly on the \"athlete.\" A CNAPS approach dictates that we should first understand the scene's composition. By using `YOLOS` for coarse detection and `m2fp` for fine-grained segmentation, we can isolate the subject of interest. The Mask2Former paper ([arXiv:2112.01527](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527)) describes it as a \"universal architecture for image segmentation,\" making it a robust choice for identifying the 'person' category. This separation is the critical first step that enables the parallel-pathway design.\n\n*   **Branching for Targeted Processing:** The core of the synaptic design is the split into foreground and background paths. The runner and the field have different degradation characteristics. The runner has motion blur, while the background is likely static. Processing them separately avoids applying an unnecessary deblurring filter to the entire image, saving computation and preventing potential artifacts in the background.\n\n*   **Choice of Deblurring Model (`Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro`):** The user wants to see the athlete's \"movements\" clearly, which points directly to **motion blur**. The MSSNet paper ([cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) introduces"
