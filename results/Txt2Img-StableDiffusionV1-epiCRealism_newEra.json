    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a CEO's profile photo by applying professional-quality retouching that emphasizes high-quality lighting and realistic skin texture. The sub-goals include:\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintaining the CEO's facial features and overall composition\n- **Texture realism**: Enhancing skin texture to appear natural and professional\n- **Lighting enhancement**: Improving illumination for a polished, corporate-appropriate appearance\n- **Image quality improvement**: Potentially addressing any blur or quality issues in the original photo\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a branching enhancement network where the input CEO photo flows through multiple specialized pathways that work synergistically. The original image first gets processed through a deblurring module to ensure optimal base quality. This enhanced image then branches into two parallel pathways: one focused on realistic texture enhancement and another on lighting/style refinement. The realistic diffusion models work to enhance skin texture and overall photorealism, while maintaining the professional corporate aesthetic. These enhanced outputs are then merged through a weighted combination process that preserves the best aspects of both enhancements, resulting in a professionally retouched CEO portrait with improved lighting and realistic skin texture.\n\n### B.

Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ**\n- **Input**: Raw CEO profile photo (any resolution)\n- **Output**: Deblurred, sharp base image\n- **Function**: Removes motion blur and enhances image clarity\n- **Reference**: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 2: Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-Realisian** \n- **Input**: Deblurred image + prompt: \"professional CEO portrait, realistic skin texture, corporate headshot\"\n- **Output**: Image with enhanced realistic skin texture and professional appearance\n- **Function**: Focuses on generating photorealistic skin texture while maintaining corporate professionalism\n\n**Module 3: Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-henmixReal**\n- **Input**: Deblurred image + prompt: \"high-quality studio lighting, professional portrait, enhanced illumination\"\n- **Output**: Image with improved lighting and overall visual quality\n- **Function**: Enhances lighting conditions and overall image aesthetics\n\n**Module 4: Weighted Merger**\n- **Input**: Outputs from both Stable Diffusion models\n- **Output**: Final composite image\n- **Function**: Combines the texture enhancements from Realisian with the lighting improvements from henmixReal using adaptive weighting\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture leverages the **MSSNet deblurring capability** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) as a preprocessing step to ensure optimal input quality for the subsequent enhancement modules. The parallel branching approach allows the **Realisian model** to focus specifically on skin texture realism while **henmixReal** handles lighting enhancement, creating a synergistic effect where each model contributes its specialized strengths. This design avoids the limitations of a single model trying to handle all enhancement aspects simultaneously, instead creating a network where specialized capabilities merge to achieve the professional retouching quality required for executive portraits.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to retouch a product photo with two main goals:\n- **Product Cleaning**: Make the product \"smooth and free of impurities.\"\n- **Background Beautification**: Make the background \"blurry under soft lighting.\"\n\nSub-goals include:\n- **Segmentation**: Accurate separation of foreground and background.\n- **Realistic Inpainting**: Fill in impurity regions with texture-aware synthesis.\n- **Soft Lighting & Blur**: Apply photo enhancement and depth-of-field effects.\n- **Final Composition**: Merge enhanced product with synthetic background seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis CNAPS-style system begins with a single input image and then splits into two parallel processing branches:\n\n- **Branch A: Foreground Cleaning**\n  - A segmentation model first identifies the product.\n  - An impurity mask is provided (e.g., by user).\n  - The inpainting model fills impurity areas to clean the product.\n\n- **Branch B: Background Enhancement**\n  - The original image is processed to create a soft lighting effect.\n  - A Gaussian blur is applied to simulate depth-of-field.\n  - This background will replace the original background.\n\nFinally, the cleaned product is composited onto the blurred, soft-lit background using the original segmentation mask.\n\n---\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a professional-grade retouch on a CEO's profile photograph. The primary goal is to enhance the image's aesthetic quality by applying a style characterized by high-quality, professional lighting and generating a more detailed, realistic skin texture.\n\nKey sub-goals are:\n\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The final image must retain the CEO's likeness, pose, and the overall composition of the original photo. The person must remain perfectly recognizable.\n*   **Texture Realism:** The retouching should focus on creating natural-looking skin, avoiding an overly smooth or artificial appearance.\n*   **Style Matching:** The lighting in the final image should emulate a professional studio setup.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the initial input branches into multiple, parallel processing paths. Each path tackles the retouching task with a different strategy, offering a range of options that can be reviewed and selected from, ensuring the best possible outcome.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins with the **[Original CEO Photo]**. This image is first passed to a conditional preprocessing module, **Deblur-MSSNet**, which sharpens the image only if it's detected to be blurry, ensuring a high-quality base for further edits.\n\nFrom there, the sharpened image becomes the input for three parallel, synaptic branches, each representing a distinct retouching strategy:\n\n1.  **Instruction-Based Path (Global Edit):** This branch uses **InstructPix2Pix** for a direct, holistic edit. The model is given a simple text command to apply the desired style across the entire image. This path is fast and provides a good baseline result.\n\n2.  **Structurally-Controlled Path (High-Fidelity Generation):** This is the most robust path for preserving the CEO's identity. It first generates a structural map of the photo using a **SoftEdge** detector. This map is then fed into **ControlNet-SoftEdge** along with a descriptive prompt. ControlNet redraws the image with the new style (\"high-quality lighting,\" \"realistic skin\") while being strictly guided by the original composition and structure.\n\n3.  **Targeted Inpainting Path (Surgical Edit):** This branch allows for a more granular, surgical retouch. It uses **CLIPSeg** to generate a precise mask of the CEO's face. This mask is then used with the **Inpaint** model to *only* regenerate the skin texture according to a specific prompt, leaving the hair, clothes, and background untouched.\n\nFinally, the outputs from these three distinct paths—the global edit, the high-fidelity regeneration, and the surgically retouched image—are presented as a set of candidate results. This allows a human operator (or a future AI evaluation module) to select the most successful retouch, embodying the \"convergent\" part of the CNAPS model.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis multi-pathway CNAPS design is superior to a linear pipeline because it mitigates the risks of a single model failing to meet all the user's nuanced requirements.\n\n1.  **Preprocessing with Deblur-MSSNet:**\n    *   **Justification:** A high-quality output requires a high-quality input. The **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** model is explicitly chosen to salvage potentially blurry source images. The paper ([MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) describes its effectiveness in creating sharp, artifact-free results by processing features at multiple scales, making it ideal for a professional preprocessing step.\n\n2.  **Path A: InstructPix2Pix for Rapid, Global"
