    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **upscale small stadium match photos by 8x magnification** to make players clearly recognizable. This is a **Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR)** task with the primary sub-goals of:\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintaining stadium architecture, field lines, and player body proportions\n- **Texture realism**: Enhancing fine details like jerseys, facial features, and grass texture\n- **Edge sharpness**: Ensuring player boundaries and equipment remain crisp at high magnification\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system implements a **multi-branch super-resolution network** that processes stadium photos through three parallel SISR pathways, each optimized for different aspects of sports imagery. The input image flows simultaneously to three specialized 8x upscaling modules: RCAN (for residual attention), DRN-S (for lightweight detail recovery), and DRN-L (for heavy computational detail enhancement). Each branch produces a candidate 8x upscaled image with different strengths—RCAN excels at preserving overall structure, DRN-S maintains computational efficiency while recovering mid-level details, and DRN-L provides maximum detail reconstruction. The system then employs an **adaptive fusion mechanism** that intelligently combines the three outputs based on local image characteristics, using RCAN's output as the structural foundation while selectively incorporating fine details from both DRN variants where they provide superior enhancement.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the complementary strengths of three state-of-the-art SISR approaches:\n\n**RCAN (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02758)** provides the structural foundation through its residual channel attention mechanism, which is crucial for maintaining the geometric integrity of stadium layouts and player proportions during 8x magnification.\n\n**DRN-S and DRN-L (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018)** offer different computational-quality trade-offs through their dilated residual architectures. The dual-branch DRN approach allows the system to capture both efficient mid-level details (DRN-S) and computationally expensive fine textures (DRN-L), which is essential for making players recognizable in sports photography.\n\nThe **synaptic fusion strategy** mimics neural processing by combining multiple specialized pathways, ensuring that the final output benefits from each model's strengths while compensating for individual weaknesses—critical for the complex visual demands of stadium photography where both macro-structure and micro-details determine player recognizability.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance **blurry food photos from social media** by **enlarging them 4x** while making **toppings and textures clear**.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Remove blur (motion or focus)\n- Perform 4× super-resolution\n- Restore fine-grained food textures (e.g., sauces, toppings, crusts)\n- Maintain photorealism and color fidelity\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input image is first routed through **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** to correct real-world blur caused by motion or defocus. The deblurred image is then sent in **parallel** to two distinct 4× super-resolution branches:\n\n- **Branch A (SISR-IMDN-4x)**: Lightweight and efficient, it quickly produces a high-quality result emphasizing texture details like grains or glistening sauce.\n- **Branch B (SISR-DRN-L-4x)**: A deeper architecture that excels at structural and perceptual realism, making it ideal for reconstructing topping geometry and edges of food items.\n\nThese two 4× outputs are fused using a **multi-scale synaptic fusion module**, which blends the high-frequency texture from IMDN with the structural consistency of DRN. The final result is a **crisp, natural-looking 4× enhanced food photo**.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform an 8x super-resolution on small stadium match photos. The primary goal is not just enlargement, but to enhance the images to a degree where individual players' faces and jersey details become recognizable.\n\nThis involves two key sub-goals:\n*   **Structural Integrity:** The overall scene, including the stadium architecture, grass texture, and field lines, must be upscaled cleanly and without geometric distortion or artifacts.\n*   **Perceptual Realism:** The most critical regions—the players—must be rendered with realistic textures and details to make their faces, expressions, and jersey numbers identifiable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input in parallel and intelligently merges the results, leveraging the unique strengths of different models to achieve a superior composite output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single low-resolution stadium photo as input. Instead of a linear process, the input \"synapses\" or branches out to three parallel modules that work simultaneously:\n\n1.  **Content Analysis Path:** A lightweight object detection module runs on the low-resolution input to identify the bounding boxes of all players. These bounding boxes are combined to create a \"player mask.\" This mask dictates which parts of the final image should prioritize perceptual realism.\n\n2.  **Structural Path (RCAN):** The input image is fed to the **SISR-RCAN-8x** model. This model excels at producing results with a high Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), making it ideal for reconstructing the clean lines and regular patterns of the stadium background, field, and grass with high fidelity.\n\n3.  **Perceptual Path (DRN):** The input image is also fed to the **SISR-DRN-L-8x** model. This model's \"dual regression\" training helps it generate more realistic and convincing textures, which is crucial for making faces and jerseys recognizable, even if its raw PSNR is sometimes lower than RCAN's.\n\nFinally, a **Merging Synapse** combines the outputs. Using the player mask from the first path, it composites the final image: the detailed player regions from the DRN-L output are placed onto the clean, structurally sound background from the RCAN output. The result is a single 8x image that is superior to what either model could produce on its own.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is justified by the distinct and complementary strengths of the selected models, as described in their respective papers.\n\n*   **Branching Rationale:** A single model is a compromise. Stadium photos contain different types of content that benefit from different super-resolution philosophies. The background requires precision (high PSNR), while the players require perceptual realism. By processing these components with specialized models in parallel, we avoid compromise and optimize for both sub-goals.\n\n*   **Module 2: SISR-RCAN-8x Justification:**\n    *   **Reference:** \"Image Super-Resolution Using a Very Deep Residual Channel Attention Network\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02758).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The paper highlights that RCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of PSNR. High PSNR correlates with low pixel-wise error, which is excellent for preserving the sharp, clean edges and geometric structures found in stadium architecture, seating, and field markings. This makes RCAN the ideal choice for the \"Structural Path.\"\n\n*   **Module 3: SISR-DRN-L-8x Justification:**\n    *   **Reference:** \"Closed-loop Matters: Dual Regression Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018).\n    *   **Reasoning:** The paper explains that the dual regression constraint forces the model to learn a more accurate image degradation mapping, leading to super-resolved images with more realistic and faithful textures. This is precisely what is needed for the user's goal of *recognizing players*. Faces, skin, and fabric textures from DRN will be perceptually more convincing than the potentially smoother output from a pure PSNR-optimized model like RCAN. We select **DRN-L** (Large) over DRN-S (Small) to maximize the quality and detail on the most important subjects, the players.\n\n*   **Merging Synapse Rationale:** The final merge is the critical step that actualizes the CNAPS concept. By using a content-aware mask, the system intelligently combines the best attributes of both models into a single, cohesive image. This targeted approach ensures that the players are recognizable (thanks to DRN-L) and the surrounding stadium is crisp and artifact-free (thanks to RCAN), fully satisfying all aspects of the user's request."
