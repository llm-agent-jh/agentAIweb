This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintaining facial features and background elements during upscaling\n- **Compression artifact removal**: Addressing quality degradation from both scanning and compression\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synaptic network** that processes the input image through specialized pathways before intelligent merging. The input image flows into two parallel branches: one optimized for compressed image restoration and another for classical super-resolution. Each branch applies 4x upscaling with its specialized approach, then the system performs **adaptive region-based fusion** where facial regions are prioritized from the compressed-optimized branch (better for detail recovery) while background regions leverage the classical branch (better for natural texture synthesis). The final output combines the strengths of both approaches through weighted blending.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Branch A - Compressed Super-Resolution:**\n- **Model**: SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x\n- **Input**: 256×256 compressed image patch\n- **Output**: 1024×1024 upscaled patch with compression artifact removal\n- **Specialization**: Optimized for JPEG compression artifacts and scanning noise\n\n**Branch B - Classical Super-Resolution:**\n- **Model**: SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x  \n- **Input**: 256×256 image patch\n- **Output**: 1024×1024 upscaled patch with natural texture synthesis\n- **Specialization**: Superior for clean texture generation and background details\n\n**Adaptive Fusion Module:**\n- **Input**: Two 4x upscaled images from branches A & B\n- **Process**: Face detection → region-based weighted blending (faces favor Branch A, backgrounds favor Branch B)\n- **Output**: Single 4x enhanced image combining both strengths\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **complementary strengths** of both Swin2SR variants as described in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345). The **Swin2SR-Compressed model** excels at handling compression artifacts common in scanned photos, while the **Classical variant** produces more natural textures for backgrounds. The synaptic branching allows parallel processing for efficiency, while the adaptive fusion ensures facial details (user's priority) benefit from compression-aware processing while backgrounds maintain natural appearance. This approach directly addresses the paper's findings that different SR models excel in different scenarios, making the branching architecture essential rather than optional.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system adopts a **dual-branch CNAPS structure**. The image is processed by two specialized 4× super-resolution branches in parallel:  \n- The **Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** branch is tuned to handle scanned/compressed image artifacts and produces rich textures and color fidelity.  \n- The **Swin2SR-Classical-4x** branch enhances natural background texture but is weaker with compression.  \nAfter both branches generate their 4× output, an **adaptive fusion module** performs face-aware blending: using compression-aware output for face regions and classical texture output for the background. This final composition ensures photorealistic restoration of both important foreground and scenic context.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** is trained on JPEG/compression artifacts and real degradations, making it ideal for restoring facial areas affected by scanning/compression【610†source】【612†source】.\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** excels in generating natural textures in less degraded zones, making it suitable for improving backgrounds and contextual elements【610†source】【613†source】.\n- The **adaptive fusion module** performs region-aware blending, prioritizing facial recovery from compressed-optimized SR and ambient realism from classical SR. This mimics the CNAPS principle of branch specialization and synaptic integration, providing clean, artifact-free super-resolution across diverse image zones.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of a CNAPS-style workflow designed to solve the user's request using the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform 4x Super-Resolution on a low-quality, compressed, scanned old photograph. The primary goal is to restore and enhance visual fidelity, specifically targeting the details and colors in both human faces and the surrounding background.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n*   **Artifact Removal:** The process must handle degradations common to old, compressed scans, such as JPEG artifacts, noise, and color banding.\n*   **Texture Synthesis:** It needs to realistically generate fine details (e.g., skin texture, hair, fabric patterns) that were lost in the low-resolution, compressed source.\n*   **Structural Preservation:** The overall composition and key structures of the image (e.g., facial features, background elements) must be maintained without distortion.\n*   **Color Restoration:** The workflow should enhance faded or shifted colors to appear more natural and vibrant.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the input image is processed through parallel, specialized branches. The outputs of these branches are then intelligently combined by a fusion module to produce a superior final result that leverages the strengths of each model.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the low-quality, compressed photo as input. Instead of feeding it into a single model, the image is routed down two parallel processing branches simultaneously.\n\n1.  **Branch 1 (High-Fidelity Restoration Path):** This branch uses the **SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** model. This model is specifically designed to handle complex, realistic degradations, including the compression artifacts mentioned by the user. Its purpose is to perform the heavy lifting of artifact removal and generate rich, realistic textures for both the face and background.\n\n2.  **Branch 2 (Structural Preservation Path):** This branch uses the **SISR-IMDN-4x** model. As a lightweight information multi-distillation network, IMDN is excellent at extracting and preserving the core hierarchical features and overall structure of the image. While it may not handle severe compression artifacts as well as Swin2SR, its output provides a strong, structurally coherent baseline.\n\n3.  **Merge / Fusion Synapse:** The 4x upscaled outputs from both branches are fed into a \"Synaptic Gating & Blending\" module. This module acts as the decision-making center. It analyzes both results, using the high-fidelity textures from the Swin2SR branch as the primary source while cross-referencing the IMDN branch's output to ensure structural consistency and prevent unrealistic \"hallucinations.\" It intelligently blends these outputs, for instance, by prioritizing Swin2SR's details while ensuring the fundamental shapes align with IMDN's stable structure.\n\nThe final output is a single, 4x enlarged image that combines the best qualities of both models: the superior detail and artifact removal of Swin2SR and the robust structural integrity of IMDN.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design Choices**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly tailored to the user's problem and the provided tools.\n\n*   **Why a Branching Workflow?** A single model, even a powerful one, has inherent biases. A CNAPS-style approach allows us to mitigate the weaknesses of one model with the strengths of another. Swin2SR might occasionally \"hallucinate\" textures that are not plausible, while IMDN provides a stable structural reference to ground the final output in reality. This synaptic fusion is superior to a simple linear pipeline.\n\n*   **Justification for Branch 1 (SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x):** This model is the cornerstone of the solution. The user's input is \"compressed\" and \"poor quality.\" The Swin2SR paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) explicitly states it targets \"realistic super-resolution\" and is trained to handle \"complex degradations\" that mimic real-world scenarios, including compression. This makes it the ideal choice for the primary path focused on removing artifacts and generating high-fidelity details.\n\n*   **Justification for Branch 2 (SISR-IMDN-4x):** The user needs to preserve the structure of faces and backgrounds. The IMDN paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)) describes an \"Information Multi-distillation Network\" that progressively extracts hierarchical features. This architecture is effective at capturing the essential information and overall structure of an image. While it's not specialized for compression artifacts, its \"lightweight\" nature and focus on feature distillation make it a perfect candidate for a parallel branch that ensures the final output doesn't stray from the original image's composition.\n\n*   **Justification for Excluding SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x:** This model is intentionally excluded. The Swin2SR paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) defines the \"Classical\" track as being trained on simple, non-blind degradations (e.g., bicubic downsampling). Applying it to a photo with complex compression artifacts and scanning noise would yield poor results, as it is not trained to recognize or remove these specific types of degradation. Including it would add no value and likely degrade the"
