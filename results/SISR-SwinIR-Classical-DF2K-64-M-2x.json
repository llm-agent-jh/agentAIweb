    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **upscale a sports game photograph by 2x while enhancing the clarity of small details** like license plates (likely referring to jersey numbers) and players' faces. The sub-goals include:\n- **Resolution enhancement** (2x upscaling)\n- **Detail preservation** for small text/numbers\n- **Face clarity improvement** \n- **Motion blur reduction** (common in sports photography)\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system receives the sports image and branches into two parallel processing paths: **deblurring** and **pose estimation**. The deblurring branch uses MSSNet models to reduce motion blur from fast-moving players. The pose estimation branch uses OpenPose to detect player locations and body keypoints. These outputs then merge at an **adaptive upscaling stage** where the pose information guides region-specific enhancement - applying stronger detail enhancement to detected player regions (especially face areas) while using standard upscaling for background areas. The final output combines the deblurred, pose-aware upscaled image.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro**\n- *Input*: Original sports image (RGB, any resolution)\n- *Output*: Deblurred image with reduced motion blur\n- *Function*: Removes motion blur from fast-moving players and camera shake\n\n**Module 2: PoseEstimation-OpenPose**  \n- *Input*: Original sports image (RGB)\n- *Output*: JSON with 25-point body keypoints per detected person, confidence scores\n- *Function*: Detects all players and extracts body pose information\n\n**Module 3: Adaptive Region-Based Upscaling**\n- *Input*: Deblurred image + pose keypoints\n- *Processing*: \n  - Face regions (keypoints 0-17): Apply aggressive detail enhancement\n  - Torso regions (keypoints 1,2,5,8,11): Moderate enhancement for jersey numbers\n  - Background: Standard 2x interpolation\n- *Output*: 2x resolution image with region-specific enhancement\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis design leverages the **MSSNet architecture's multi-scale approach** (from the POSTECH paper) which is specifically designed for real-world blur scenarios common in sports photography. The **OpenPose integration** (from the CMU ArXiv paper) provides precise human keypoint detection that enables **spatially-aware processing** - a key advantage over simple uniform upscaling.\n\nThe synaptic branching allows **parallel processing** of deblurring and pose detection, then **intelligent merging** based on semantic understanding of where players (and their important details) are located. This CNAPS approach ensures computational efficiency while maximizing detail enhancement where it matters most.\n\n**References:**\n- MSSNet: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n- OpenPose: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enlarge a photo of a sports game by 2×** while improving the **clarity of small player details**, particularly **faces** and **jersey numbers** (referred to as \"license plates\").\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Reduce motion blur common in sports images\n- Enhance player face clarity\n- Improve legibility of jersey numbers\n- Perform global 2x resolution enhancement with local refinements\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system first reduces motion blur via `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro`, then detects player poses with `PoseEstimation-OpenPose`. Using the detected keypoints, the system identifies regions corresponding to player faces and torsos (where jersey numbers reside). These areas receive stronger enhancement in a **region-adaptive 2x upscaling stage**, while the rest of the image undergoes standard interpolation. The final result merges all regions seamlessly into a unified, high-resolution sports photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro** was designed to remove motion blur common in dynamic scenes like sports, using multi-scale supervision and attention mechanisms【653†source】.\n- **PoseEstimation-OpenPose** precisely localizes players and their body parts, which enables spatially targeted enhancement of faces and jersey numbers【653†source】.\n- The **region-adaptive upscaling module** allows different enhancement strategies:\n  - **Faces and jersey areas**: sharpened and contrast-enhanced\n  - **Background and field**: standard 2× interpolation, avoiding overprocessing\n\nThis **CNAPS-style architecture** mimics neural attention by assigning enhancement effort where detail matters most (e.g., faces, numbers), while preserving global visual harmony.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform a 2x super-resolution on a photograph of a sports game. The primary goal is to enhance the clarity and legibility of two specific types of features: the faces of the players and the numbers on their jerseys (interpreted from the user's mention of \"players' license plates\").\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Feature-Specific Enhancement:** Faces and numbers must be exceptionally clear and recognizable.\n*   **Global Enhancement:** The entire image (background, field, etc.) must be enlarged coherently.\n*   **Structure Preservation & Realism:** The final image must look natural and seamless, without obvious artifacts from combining different model outputs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the input image through a branched, synaptic network. Instead of a single linear pipeline, the workflow splits to handle different parts of the image with specialized models, then merges the results for a superior final output.\n\n1.  **Input & Initial Deblurring:** The low-resolution sports photo is first fed into a deblurring model. Sports photography often contains motion blur, and addressing this first provides a cleaner base for all subsequent steps.\n\n2.  **Synaptic Split:** After deblurring, the workflow branches into two parallel paths:\n    *   **Path A (Global Super-Resolution):** This path handles the entire image. It uses a powerful general-purpose super-resolution model to upscale the deblurred image 2x, enhancing the overall scene, including the jersey numbers.\n    *   **Path B (Face-Specific Restoration):** This path runs concurrently. It first uses a pose estimation model on the *original* image to detect the precise location of every player's face. Each detected face is cropped and sent to a specialized face restoration model. This model is designed to reconstruct high-fidelity facial details, far surpassing what a general upscaler can do.\n\n3.  **Synaptic Merge & Integration:** The outputs from both paths are intelligently combined. The high-quality, restored faces from Path B are precisely pasted back into the globally upscaled image from Path A. This is done by scaling the original face coordinates to match the new 2x resolution. A blending algorithm is used at the seams to ensure the integration is invisible.\n\n4.  **Final Output:** The result is a single, high-resolution image where the entire scene is enlarged, but the faces have received expert-level restoration, fulfilling the user's request for clarity on both numbers and faces.\n\n### B.

Justification of Model Choices & Design\n\nThis CNAPS design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because it applies specialized tools precisely where they are most effective.\n\n*   **Initial Deblurring (`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`):** A sports photo is likely to suffer from motion or out-of-focus blur. Applying `Deblur-MSSNet` first is critical. This model is trained on the `RealBlur-R` dataset, making it ideal for deblurring real-world images with complex blur kernels, as opposed to synthetic ones. This step provides a higher quality input for both subsequent branches"

    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": "Excellent CNAPS-style design with true synaptic branching and merging. Uses mostly provided models (MSSNet, OpenPose, CodeFormer) with clear justification. The workflow genuinely splits into parallel paths and intelligently merges results. Minor deduction for mentioning Real-ESRGAN which wasn't in the provided list, but the overall architecture is superior. Best clarity with detailed mermaid diagram and step-by-step explanation.",
    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This is an outstanding response and the clear winner. It presents a highly sophisticated and practical CNAPS workflow that uses specialized models for each sub-task (`Real-ESRGAN` for global upscaling, `CodeFormer` for face restoration). This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the problem by recognizing that face restoration and general super-resolution require different tools. It uses specific models for every step, perfectly adhering to the prompt's constraints. The use of a Mermaid diagram and the detailed, specific reasoning for each model choice make it superior across all criteria."
