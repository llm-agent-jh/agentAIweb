    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **organize and enhance landscape photos from the Internet to achieve natural-looking images without color bleeding artifacts**. This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Color correction and bleeding removal**: Eliminating unnatural color artifacts and restoring realistic color transitions\n- **Image quality enhancement**: Improving overall visual quality including potential dehazing and deblurring for natural appearance\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where input landscape photos are simultaneously processed through multiple specialized pathways that address different quality issues. The workflow branches into three parallel processing streams: weather/atmospheric correction, color enhancement, and blur correction. Each stream processes the input independently, then their outputs are intelligently merged based on image quality metrics and content analysis. The system uses conditional routing to determine which enhancements are most needed for each specific image, allowing for adaptive processing that preserves the natural characteristics of landscape photography.\n\n### B.

Workflow Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design addresses the user's specific needs through **parallel specialized processing** rather than sequential enhancement. The **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** module handles atmospheric issues common in landscape photography, while **Colorization-DISCO-c0_2** specifically targets color bleeding artifacts mentioned by the user. The DISCO paper demonstrates effectiveness in color harmonization and preventing color bleeding through its dual-stream architecture. **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** ensures sharp, natural-looking landscapes by addressing real-world blur patterns as documented in their research on multi-scale blur handling.\n\nThe **synaptic branching approach** allows each module to specialize in its domain while the fusion module intelligently combines their strengths, ensuring the final output maintains the natural characteristics essential for landscape photography organization.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is first converted to a luminance-preserving grayscale format to isolate structural detail. This structure flows through two enhancement modules in sequence: first `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` removes blur, then `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` improves clarity and contrast. Once the structural quality is optimal, the image is passed to `Colorization-DISCO-c0_2`, which synthesizes natural-looking colors aligned with the grayscale template.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS-style branching and merging structure is tailored to avoid color bleeding while maximizing clarity:\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** corrects real-world blur, which is common in compressed or poorly captured internet photos【287†source】.\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** enhances overall clarity by removing haze and flattening atmospheric gradients【287†source】.\n- **Colorization-DISCO-c0_2** generates entirely new color channels from the structure-only input, thereby eliminating residual color bleeding from the original RGB image【287†source】.\n- This grayscale→enhance→colorize approach ensures that structure and luminance guide the final appearance, producing clean, photorealistic landscape results.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to automate the enhancement of landscape photos sourced from the internet. The primary goal is to make them appear photorealistic and \"natural,\" with a specific constraint to eliminate \"color bleeding\" and other color-related artifacts.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n*   **Structure Preservation & Enhancement:** The process must sharpen details and remove blur.\n*   **Clarity Improvement:** The workflow should remove atmospheric obstructions like haze.\n*   **Natural Color Rendition:** The final colors must be coherent, realistic, and free from artifacts like bleeding or unnatural saturation.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed around a \"divide and conquer\" principle. It separates the problem of structural enhancement (sharpness, clarity) from color generation. This is a classic and robust computer vision strategy, as color information can often interfere with models that analyze image structure (like edges and textures). By processing structure on a grayscale image first, we provide a clean, high-quality foundation for the final colorization step.\n\n---\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system takes a potentially low-quality color landscape photo as input. The workflow immediately branches.\n\n*   **The primary branch, the \"Structure Path,\"** converts the image to grayscale to isolate its luminance and structural information. This grayscale image is then sequentially passed through two modules: first, the `Deblur-MSSNet` model to correct for motion blur, and second, the `WeatherRemoval-DeHaze` model to enhance contrast and clarity. The output of this branch is a sharp, clear, structurally-sound grayscale image.\n\n*   **The \"Color Synapse\"** acts as the merging point. The `Colorization-DISCO` model receives the structurally enhanced grayscale image from the first branch. Using this high-quality structural template, it generates entirely new, natural-looking colors. This process inherently solves the \"color bleeding\" problem by replacing the flawed original colors instead of trying to fix them.\n\nThe final output is a single, high-quality RGB image that is sharp, clear, and has natural, coherent colors.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification for Design Choices\n\nThis CNAPS architecture is specifically tailored to the user's request and is justified by the capabilities of the selected models.\n\n1.  **Branching Strategy (Structure/Color Split):** The initial split into a grayscale structural path is a deliberate choice. Low-quality internet images often have compression artifacts, poor saturation, and color noise. These color issues can degrade the performance of structural models like deblurring and dehazing, which rely on clean gradient and texture information. By converting to grayscale, we provide a clean input to the structural enhancement models, maximizing their effectiveness.\n\n2.  **Module 1: `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`**\n    *   **Justification:** Internet photos are frequently affected by camera shake or subject motion. The `MSSNet` paper explicitly targets **\"Real-World Motion Deblurring\"** ([MSSNet Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)). Placing this first ensures that the subsequent haze removal model works on a sharp image, which can improve its ability to distinguish between fine details and haze.\n    *   **Placement:** It is the first processing step in the structure branch to establish a sharp foundation.\n\n3.  **Module 2: `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`**\n    *   **Justification:** Landscape photos are prime candidates for atmospheric haze, which reduces contrast and makes them look washed out or \"unnatural.\" This model directly addresses that sub-goal.\n    *   **Placement:** It follows the deblurring step. A sharp image provides better information for the dehazing algorithm to differentiate between distant objects and atmospheric effects.\n\n4.  **Module 3: `Colorization-DISCO-c0_2` (The Synapse)**\n    *   **Justification:** This is the key to solving the user's primary constraint: **\"without color bleeding.\"** Instead of trying to correct the existing, flawed colors, this workflow discards them and generates new ones. The DISCO paper describes a diffusion model for **\"high-quality image-to-image translation\"** ([DISCO Paper](https://menghanxia.github.io/projects/disco/disco_main.pdf)). By feeding it a high-quality grayscale image, we task it with its core strength: generating plausible and aesthetically pleasing content (in this case, color) that conforms to the provided structure. This approach effectively prevents color bleeding because the colors are generated holistically based on the image's content, ensuring coherence.\n    *   **Placement:** It serves as the final \"synapse,\" merging the enhanced structure with newly generated color to produce the final, high-quality output. This ensures the color is applied to the best possible version of the image."
