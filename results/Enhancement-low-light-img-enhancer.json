    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a dark and noisy concert hall photograph by improving lighting conditions and color quality to make it clearer and more visually appealing.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Low-light enhancement to brighten dark areas\n- Noise reduction to eliminate visual artifacts\n- Color correction and saturation improvement\n- Detail preservation during enhancement processes\n- Maintaining natural appearance of the concert hall environment\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a synapse-like network where the input image flows through parallel processing branches that handle different aspects of image degradation. The dark, noisy concert hall photo enters the network and immediately branches into two specialized pathways: one focused on low-light enhancement and another on noise reduction. These branches process the image simultaneously, with each module producing intermediate enhanced versions. The outputs then converge at a fusion point where the enhanced lighting information from the low-light enhancer is intelligently combined with the denoised image structure from the SwinIR modules. A conditional routing mechanism determines which noise reduction strength (Noise15 vs Noise25) to apply based on the detected noise level in the original image. The final output merges the best aspects of both enhancement pathways to produce a clear, well-lit, and noise-free concert hall photograph.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **SwinIR Transformer architecture** for superior noise reduction, as demonstrated in the referenced paper's state-of-the-art performance on image restoration tasks. The parallel processing approach allows simultaneous handling of the two main degradation factors (darkness and noise) without one process interfering with the other.\n\nThe **conditional branching** between SwinIR-Noise15 and SwinIR-Noise25 ensures optimal noise reduction strength selection, preventing over-smoothing on moderately noisy images while providing sufficient denoising for heavily corrupted areas typical in low-light concert photography.\n\nThe **synaptic fusion** at the end combines the enhanced lighting with clean image structure, addressing the user's specific requirements for both \"improving lighting\" and making the image \"clearer\" through noise reduction.\n\n**References:**\n- SwinIR Paper: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/AIM/papers/Liang_SwinIR_Image_Restoration_Using_Swin_Transformer_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf",

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow design for the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a dark, noisy photograph of a concert hall. The primary goal is to improve its visual clarity by simultaneously enhancing the lighting and colors while removing the digital noise.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** Increase the overall brightness and reveal details hidden in the shadows.\n*   **Denoising:** Remove unwanted digital grain without sacrificing important details.\n*   **Color Correction:** Restore or enhance the vibrancy and accuracy of the colors, which are often muted or shifted in low-light conditions.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the original architecture and composition of the concert hall.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Ensure that surfaces (e.g., wood, fabric, metal) look natural and not overly smooth or \"plastic-like\" after processing.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network with two main branches that process the image in parallel and then merge their specialized outputs for a superior final result. This approach avoids the common pitfall of a linear pipeline where enhancing a dark image first would amplify the noise, making it much harder to remove.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins by taking the single \"Dark, Noisy Image\" as input. This input immediately synapses, or splits, into two parallel processing branches.\n\n*   **Branch 1 (The Structure & Detail Path):** This branch focuses exclusively on cleaning the image and preserving its structural integrity. It first uses a conditional sub-branch to select the most appropriate denoising model (`SwinIR-Noise15` or `SwinIR-Noise25`) based on the image's estimated noise level. Its final output is a clean, denoised version of the original image, which serves as the high-fidelity structural foundation.\n\n*   **Branch 2 (The Light & Color Path):** This branch focuses on correcting the lighting and color issues. The original image is fed into the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` model to produce a bright and colorful, but likely still noisy, version of the image.\n\nFinally, the outputs from both branches converge at a **Color Space Fusion** module. This module intelligently combines the best of both worlds: it takes the clean luminance (brightness and detail) from Branch 1 and the enhanced chrominance (color information) from Branch 2. By merging these components and converting them back to a standard image format, the system produces a final image that is clear, bright, vibrant, and structurally intact.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Visual Flow Diagram (block-style, text-based)**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Input: Dark, Noisy Image] --> B{Synapse 1: Split Input};\n\n    B --> C[Branch 1: Structure & Detail Path];\n    B --> D[Branch 2: Light & Color Path];\n\n    subgraph Branch 1\n        C --> E[Module: Noise Level Estimator];\n        E --> F{Conditional Path};\n        F -- \"High Noise (e.g., > 20)\" --> G[Model: Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25];\n        F -- \"Low Noise (e.g., <= 20)\" --> H[Model: Denoise-SwinIR-Noise15];\n        G --> I[Intermediate Output: Denoised_Image (RGB)];\n        H --> I;\n    end\n\n    subgraph Branch 2\n        D --> J[Model: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer];\n        J --> K[Intermediate Output: Enhanced_Image (RGB)];\n    end\n\n    I --> L{Synapse 2: Merge Point};\n    K --> L;\n\n    subgraph Fusion\n        L --> M[Module: Color Space Fusion];\n        M --> N[\"1.

Combine Channels: (Y_detail, Cb_color, Cr_color)\"];\n        M --> Q[\"4. Convert combined YCbCr back to RGB\"];\n    end\n\n    Q --> R[Final Output: Clear, Enhanced Image];\n\n```\n\n---\n\n### **3. Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is architected to maximize the strengths of the provided models while mitigating their individual weaknesses.\n\n1.  **Parallel Branching vs. Linear Pipeline:** A simple linear pipeline (e.g., Denoise → Enhance) risks having the enhancement step introduce artifacts or alter the texture that the denoiser worked hard to preserve. A different linear pipeline (Enhance → Denoise) is worse, as enhancing a low-light image dramatically amplifies existing noise, making it much more difficult for `SwinIR` to remove it cleanly. Our parallel design isolates the tasks: `SwinIR` focuses purely on structure, and `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` focuses purely on light/color.\n\n2.  **Conditional Denoising Path:** Low-light images can have varying levels of noise. Using a single denoiser is suboptimal. By incorporating a **Noise Level Estimator**, the workflow can dynamically select the most suitable model.\n    *   **`Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25`** is chosen for heavily noisy images.\n    *   **`Denoise-SwinIR-Noise15`** is chosen for moderately noisy images, which may prevent over-smoothing that a stronger denoiser could cause.\n    This conditional logic makes the workflow more robust and adaptive.\n\n3.  **Model Selection & Justification:**\n    *   **SwinIR Models:** The **SwinIR paper** ([https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/AIM/papers/Liang_SwinIR_Image_Restoration_Using_Swin_Transformer_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/AIM/papers/Liang_SwinIR_Image_Restoration_Using_Swin_Transformer_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf)) demonstrates that the Swin Transformer architecture is highly effective for image restoration tasks like denoising. It excels at capturing long-range dependencies in an image, which is critical for preserving fine textures and structural details—exactly what is needed for the \"Structure & Detail Path.\"\n    *   **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer:** This model is used for its specified purpose: improving brightness and color. By placing it in a separate branch, we leverage its ability to correct illumination without letting its potential side effects (like noise amplification) contaminate the final structural detail.\n\n4.  **Color Space Fusion:** The merge step is the most critical part"
