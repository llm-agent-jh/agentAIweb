    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a low-contrast night photograph by emphasizing light and shade to create more dramatic visual impact. The primary goal is **contrast enhancement** with **light-shadow emphasis** while maintaining natural appearance.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Preserve image structure and details\n- Enhance local contrast without over-saturation\n- Maintain realistic lighting transitions\n- Reduce noise that may be amplified during enhancement\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the low-contrast night photo through a **branching enhancement network**. The input image flows to an initial low-light enhancement module that brightens and recovers details. This enhanced output then branches into two parallel paths: one for noise reduction (since enhancement often amplifies noise) and another that feeds back to create a **contrast-aware enhancement loop**. The denoised version and the contrast-enhanced version are then intelligently merged, with the system potentially using the denoised version to guide final contrast adjustments. This creates a synapse-like network where information flows bidirectionally between enhancement and denoising modules.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Workflow\n\n**Module 1: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input:** Raw low-contrast night photo (RGB image)\n- **Process:** Initial brightening and detail recovery\n- **Output:** Enhanced base image with improved visibility\n- **Format:** RGB image with lifted shadows and enhanced details\n\n**Module 2A: Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25** \n- **Input:** Enhanced base image from Module 1\n- **Process:** Noise reduction using Swin Transformer architecture\n- **Output:** Clean version with reduced noise artifacts\n- **Format:** Denoised RGB image\n- **Reference:** SwinIR paper (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/AIM/papers/Liang_SwinIR_Image_Restoration_Using_Swin_Transformer_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf)\n\n**Module 2B: Contrast Enhancement Loop**\n- **Input:** Enhanced base image from Module 1\n- **Process:** Secondary enhancement pass focused on light-shadow contrast\n- **Output:** High-contrast version with emphasized light and shade\n- **Format:** RGB image with enhanced local contrast\n\n**Module 3: Intelligent Merge**\n- **Input:** Clean version (2A) + High-contrast version (2B)\n- **Process:** Adaptive blending based on local image characteristics\n- **Output:** Final enhanced night photo\n- **Format:** RGB image balancing contrast enhancement with noise control\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design addresses the specific challenge of night photo enhancement where **contrast improvement often amplifies noise**. The branching architecture allows simultaneous processing of enhancement and denoising, which is crucial for low-light images.\n\n**Key Design Decisions:**\n\n1. **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** as the primary module handles the core low-light enhancement task.\n\n2. **Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25** is essential because the SwinIR architecture (referenced paper) uses Swin Transformers which excel at capturing long-range dependencies in images - critical for maintaining structure while removing noise that gets amplified during enhancement.\n\n3. The **synaptic branching** after initial enhancement allows parallel processing of noise reduction and contrast enhancement, preventing the typical issue where these operations interfere with each other when applied sequentially.\n\n4. The **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** module is not included as it's designed for atmospheric haze removal, not relevant to the night photo contrast enhancement task.\n\nThis workflow creates a true synapse-like network where information flows through multiple pathways and reconverges, rather than a simple linear pipeline.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user’s goal is to enhance a low-contrast night photograph with lighting by emphasizing the interplay between light and shadow. The desired effect is a more dramatic and visually compelling image while preserving realism.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Improving overall contrast\n- Enhancing light/shadow dynamics\n- Maintaining structure and realism\n- Minimizing amplified noise\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input night image is first processed by a low-light enhancement model that lifts brightness and reveals hidden details. This output is passed through a denoising module to suppress artifacts commonly amplified during enhancement. Parallel to this, a contrast-specific loop re-enhances local luminance to intensify light and shade differentiation. These two outputs—denoised and high-contrast—are adaptively merged using a luminance-aware mask to balance detail, clarity, and visual drama in the final image.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\nThis workflow reflects a synaptic CNAPS system where enhancement, denoising, and contrast refinement operate in parallel and reconverge. The SwinIR denoiser is crucial to suppressing enhancement artifacts, while the contrast loop selectively amplifies light/shadow dynamics. Their luminance-aware fusion maintains balance between artistic expression and structural integrity.\n\nModels not used:\n- `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`: Irrelevant for nighttime contrast tasks lacking haze.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform an artistic retouch on a low-light night photograph. The primary goal is to increase the image's dynamic range and visual impact by selectively brightening the highlights and deepening the shadows, a technique often called \"local contrast enhancement\" or creating \"dramatic lighting.\"\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Low-Light Correction:** Brighten the image to reveal details hidden in dark areas.\n*   **Noise Reduction:** Clean up the sensor noise that is inherent in night photography and is often amplified by enhancement algorithms.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the original composition and structural integrity of the scene without introducing significant artifacts.\n*   **Contrast Enhancement:** Artistically emphasize the interplay between light and shadow rather than applying a simple, uniform brightness boost.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThe proposed workflow is a branched, non-linear system. It processes the input image along two parallel paths—an **Enhancement Path** and a **Guidance Path**—which are then intelligently merged using a derived mask to produce the final, artistically retouched image.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system begins when the user's **Input Night Photo** is fed into the network. At the first synapse, the workflow branches.\n\n1.  **Enhancement Path:** The input image is sent to the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` module. This module brightens the image globally, revealing details in the shadows but also inevitably amplifying the underlying sensor noise. The noisy, enhanced image is then passed to the `Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25` module. This powerful denoiser cleans the image, producing an intermediate result: a clean, bright, and detailed image, which we'll call the `Enhanced_Clean_Image`.\n\n2.  **Guidance Path:** In parallel, the original **Input Night Photo** is kept as a reference. It contains the ground-truth color, mood, and structural information, which can be lost or altered during aggressive enhancement.\n\n3.  **Synaptic Merge & Synthesis:** This is the critical step where the two branches converge. Instead of a simple blend, the system uses the `Enhanced_Clean_Image` to generate a **Luminance Mask**. This mask highlights the areas of the image that are now bright. This mask acts as a \"synaptic signal\" that controls the final merge. The system then performs a masked recombination: it uses the Luminance Mask to blend the detailed, bright pixels from the `Enhanced_Clean_Image` with the original, moodier pixels from the **Input Night Photo**. This process ensures that highlights are emphasized with new detail while shadows retain their depth and original color tones, achieving the user's goal of \"emphasized light and shade\" in a controlled, non-destructive manner.\n\nThe final result is a single, retouched image that balances clarity, low noise, and the desired artistic contrast.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS-style design was chosen because a simple linear pipeline (e.g., Enhance -> Denoise) would likely fail to meet the user's artistic goal of \"emphasized light and shade\" and could result in an unnaturally flat or over-brightened image.\n\n1.  **Model Selection & Rejection:**\n    *   **Chosen:** `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` is selected as it directly addresses the core problem of a \"night photo\" with low visibility.\n    *   **Chosen:** `Denoise-SwinIR-Noise25` is essential because low-light enhancement algorithms are known to significantly amplify noise. According to its paper ([Liang et al., 2021, ICCVW](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021W/AIM/papers/Liang_SwinIR_Image_Restoration_Using_Swin_Transformer_ICCVW_2021_paper.pdf)), SwinIR is a state-of-the-art image restoration model that excels at removing noise while preserving high-frequency details and textures, which is critical for a high-quality final image.\n    *   **Rejected:** `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` is not used. The user described a \"night photo,\" not a hazy or foggy one. Applying a de-hazing model would be irrelevant and could introduce unwanted color shifts or artifacts.\n\n2.  **Justification of the Synaptic (Branching) Structure:**\n    *   **Problem with Linearity:** A linear approach lacks control. Simply running the image through an enhancer and denoiser would produce one specific result, which may not align with the artistic intent. It might wash out the shadows completely, destroying the \"shade\" component the user wants to emphasize.\n    *   **Benefit of the CNAPS Design:** The branched structure separates the task of **detail recovery** from **artistic blending**.\n        *   The **Enhancement Path** is optimized for one thing: extracting maximum detail and brightness from the dark image and then cleaning it.\n        *   The **Guidance Path** preserves the original image's mood and color information.\n        *   The **Synaptic Merge** is the \"intelligent\" part of the network. By generating a luminance mask from the enhanced image, the system creates its own understanding of the \"light and shade\" structure. This mask then guides a sophisticated blend, allowing the final image to inherit the clean details from the enhancement path while retaining the color fidelity and desired contrast balance from the original. This directly achieves the user's nuanced request for \"emphasized light and shade\" far more effectively than a simple filter."
