Core Task\nThe user wants to **restore a blurry face image** caused by camera shake in low-light subway conditions, transforming it into a clear, detailed portrait. The sub-goals include:\n- **Motion blur removal** (primary deblurring)\n- **Facial structure preservation** (maintaining identity and proportions)\n- **Detail enhancement** (recovering fine facial features)\n- **Noise reduction** (addressing low-light artifacts)\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input blurry face image flows through multiple specialized deblurring pathways simultaneously. The MSSNet architecture's multi-scale approach allows for **parallel processing** at different resolution levels, with each branch handling specific aspects of the blur removal task. The network branches into three specialized deblurring modules trained on different datasets (RealBlurR, RealBlurJ, and GoPro), processes the image through multi-scale feature extraction, and then **merges the results** through a weighted fusion mechanism based on confidence scores and blur characteristics.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: MSSNet-RealBlurR**\n- **Input**: 256×256 RGB face image\n- **Function**: Handles realistic blur patterns from camera shake\n- **Output**: Deblurred face with preserved skin texture\n- **Confidence Score**: Based on edge sharpness metrics\n\n**Module 2: MSSNet-RealBlurJ**\n- **Input**: Same 256×256 RGB face image\n- **Function**: Specializes in motion blur with different kernel characteristics\n- **Output**: Alternative deblurred reconstruction\n- **Confidence Score**: Based on facial landmark detection accuracy\n\n**Module 3: MSSNet-L-GoPro**\n- **Input**: Same 256×256 RGB face image\n- **Function**: Handles complex motion blur patterns\n- **Output**: Third deblurred candidate\n- **Confidence Score**: Based on overall image quality assessment\n\n**Fusion Module**:\n- **Input**: Three deblurred candidates + confidence scores\n- **Function**: Weighted pixel-wise combination\n- **Output**: Final enhanced face image\n- **Weights**: Dynamically calculated based on local blur characteristics\n\n### D. Justification and References\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Multi-Scale Stacked Network (MSSNet)** architecture's inherent ability to process images at multiple resolutions simultaneously. According to the MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf), the multi-scale approach is particularly effective for **real-world blur scenarios** like the subway photo described.\n\nThe **three-branch parallel processing** strategy is justified because:\n1. **RealBlurR** and **RealBlurJ** are trained on different real-world blur datasets, capturing diverse blur patterns\n2. **L-GoPro** provides complementary motion blur handling capabilities\n3. The **synaptic fusion** approach mimics biological neural networks, where multiple pathways contribute to final perception\n\nThe workflow's **branching and merging structure** ensures robust performance across different blur types while maintaining computational efficiency through parallel processing, making it ideal for the complex, real-world blur scenario described in the user's subway photograph.",

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request, leveraging the provided models and research paper.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a single, blurry photograph of a person's face, making it sharp and detailed. The blur was caused by camera shake in a low-light environment (a subway at night), which implies a complex, non-uniform motion blur and potential image noise.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove the motion blur caused by shaking hands.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the correct and recognizable structure of the person's face.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Restore fine details like skin texture, hair strands, and eye features with high fidelity.\n*   **Artifact Suppression:** Avoid introducing new visual artifacts during the restoration process.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input in parallel through specialized branches and then intelligently merges the results for an optimal outcome.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe input blurry image is simultaneously routed into two parallel processing branches, each powered by a different variant of the MSSNet model.\n\n*   **Branch A (Realistic Texture Path):** This branch uses `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`, a model specifically trained on real-world, compressed (JPEG) images with complex blurs. Its primary goal is to produce the most realistic and texturally accurate deblurring, as it is best matched to the user's input conditions.\n*   **Branch B (Structural Guidance Path):** This branch uses `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro`, a model trained on the synthetic GoPro dataset. While less effective on real-world artifacts, it often produces results with strong structural coherence and fewer unpredictable hallucinations. Its purpose is to serve as a reliable structural guide.\n\nThe outputs from both branches are then fed into a **Quality Assessor** module. This module analyzes both results. If the result from the *Realistic Texture Path* is determined to be of exceptionally high quality on its own, it is passed directly to the output.\n\nHowever, if both results have merit, they proceed to a **Guided Fusion** module. Here, the structurally stable output from Branch B is used to \"guide\" the filtering of the texturally rich output from Branch A. This process merges the best qualities of both: the fine details from the RealBlur-J model and the structural integrity from the GoPro model, producing a final, high-quality restored image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Step-by-Step Module Breakdown**\n\n**Module 1: Input Router**\n*   **Action:** Receives the user's single blurry image.\n*   **Routing:** Creates two identical copies of the input image and sends one to Module 2A and the other to Module 2B, initiating parallel processing.\n*   **Output:** Two identical image streams.\n\n**Module 2A: Realistic Texture Path**\n*   **Model:** `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`\n*   **Rationale:** The user's image is from a real-world scenario (\"subway,\" \"shaking hands\") and is almost certainly a JPEG. The **MSSNet paper** explicitly states the RealBlur dataset was created to address the limitations of synthetic datasets by capturing complex blurs \"in the wild.\" The `RealBlurJ` variant is trained on JPEG images, making it the most specialized and powerful tool for this specific task.\n*   **Intermediate Output (A):** A deblurred RGB image. This output is expected to have the best restoration of fine textures and the most effective removal of the specific type of motion blur.\n\n**Module 2B: Structural Guidance Path**\n*   **Model:** `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro`\n*   **Rationale:** The GoPro dataset, as described in the paper, is synthetically generated. Models trained on it are excellent at handling general motion blur but can struggle with the noise and non-uniformity of real-world captures. We use this model not for its texture, but for its tendency to produce a structurally coherent and stable result, which can serve as a reliable \"scaffold\" for the final image.\n*   **Intermediate Output (B):** A deblurred RGB image. This output is expected to have strong, clear edges and facial structure, even if it lacks realistic micro-textures.\n\n**Module 3: Quality Assessor & Fusion Logic**\n*   **Action:** This control module receives both Intermediate Outputs A and B. It uses a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric (e.g., measuring sharpness and residual blur) to score both images.\n*   **Logic:**\n    1.  It compares the quality score of Output A (`RealBlurJ` result) against a predefined high-quality threshold.\n    2.  **Conditional Path 1 (Bypass):** If Output A's score is above the threshold and significantly higher than Output B's, the system determines it needs no further correction. The logic routes Output A directly to the final output.\n    3.  **Conditional Path 2 (Fusion):** If Output A is not of sufficient quality or if Output B offers significant structural advantages, the logic routes both outputs to the Guided Fusion module.\n*   **Output:** A decision flag (Bypass/Fuse) and the corresponding image(s).\n\n**Module 4: Guided Fusion (Conditional)**\n*   **Action:** This module is only activated if the Fusion path is chosen. It performs a guided image filtering operation.\n*   **Rationale:** We want to combine the realistic texture from Output A with the stable structure of Output B. A guided filter is perfect for this. It uses one image (the guide) to"
