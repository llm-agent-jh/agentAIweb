    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance product model photos to achieve natural, realistic appearance with specific focus on accurately representing Asian skin tones and facial expressions. The core goal is photo retouching/enhancement rather than generation from scratch.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Preserve original photo structure and composition\n- Enhance skin tone accuracy for Asian features\n- Improve facial expression naturalness and realism\n- Maintain product visibility and marketing appeal\n- Achieve photorealistic quality\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **refinement-focused synaptic network** where the original product photos flow through specialized enhancement pathways. The input image branches into multiple processing streams: one pathway analyzes and preserves the original structure/composition, while parallel branches use different realistic diffusion models to generate enhanced versions with improved Asian skin tones and expressions. These enhanced outputs are then intelligently merged using the structural guidance from the preservation pathway, with a feedback loop that allows for iterative refinement until optimal realism is achieved.\n\n### B.

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance product model photos to make them appear natural and realistic, with special attention to Asian skin tones and detailed facial expressions.  \nKey sub-goals include:\n- Maintain the original facial identity and photo composition\n- Improve realism and texture of skin while avoiding over-smoothing\n- Express Asian facial features accurately\n- Enhance subtle emotional expression\n- Keep the image suitable for commercial product use\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a multi-path enhancement network focused on realism and ethnic facial representation.  \nThe original image is routed into:\n\n1. A **structure-preserving pipeline** that maintains facial geometry and overall composition.\n2. Two enhancement branches:\n   - **Realisian model**, which targets accurate Asian skin tone and texture.\n   - **henmixReal model**, which focuses on improving facial expression and realism.\n\nOutputs from both enhancement branches are merged and refined by **majicMix-realistic**, a final-stage model that balances detail, lighting, and consistency. An intelligent merger ensures that the refined output still respects the original facial layout and composition. If the realism score does not meet threshold, the image goes through another enhancement-refinement cycle.\n\n---\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform high-fidelity, realistic retouching on existing product model photos. The primary goal is to enhance the natural beauty of the models, with a specific focus on achieving detailed and authentic Asian skin tones and preserving nuanced facial expressions.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Identity Preservation:** The retouched model must look like the original person.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Skin pores, fine lines, and hair must look natural, not plastic or overly smooth.\n*   **Color & Tone Accuracy:** Skin tones must be rendered realistically and match the \"Asian\" descriptor.\n*   **Expression Integrity:** The subtlety of the model's facial expression must be maintained or enhanced, not erased.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the input image signal branches into parallel processing streams—one for global, contextual editing and another for specialized, high-detail facial restoration. The results are then intelligently merged for a final, superior output.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system takes a single product model photograph as input. This input image is immediately sent down two parallel branches, activating different specialized modules simultaneously.\n\n*   **Branch A (Global Contextual Editing):** The image is sent to the **InstructPix2Pix** model along with a text-based instruction, such as \"Realistically enhance the lighting and enrich the skin tones to look warm and natural.\" This module performs global adjustments to the entire image—improving lighting, color balance, and overall mood—while preserving the general composition.\n\n*   **Branch B (Specialized Facial Enhancement):** In parallel, the same input image is sent to two competing face restoration models, **CodeFormer** and **GFPGAN**.\n    *   **CodeFormer** focuses on high-fidelity restoration, correcting flaws while strictly preserving the model's identity and natural facial structure. This path is optimized for realism.\n    *   **GFPGAN** focuses on generating a high-quality, often idealized facial result by leveraging a strong generative prior. This path is optimized for aesthetic appeal, which may slightly alter identity.\n\n*   **Synaptic Cleft & Merge:** The outputs from these branches are then integrated. The globally-edited image from Branch A serves as the new background and body. The system then composites the high-detail face from Branch B onto this base. A key feature of this CNAPS design is a **conditional merge**: the user can be presented with a choice between the CodeFormer (high-fidelity) face and the GFPGAN (high-quality) face to select the one that best meets their artistic and commercial needs.\n\nThe final output is a single, seamlessly retouched image that combines the best of global contextual edits and specialized facial realism.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is architected to maximize quality and control by leveraging the unique strengths of each selected model, as justified by their respective papers.\n\n*   **Branch A: InstructPix2Pix for Global Edits:** The user's request to \"retouch\" the photo implies broad, instruction-based changes. **InstructPix2Pix** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800)) is uniquely suited for this. Its paper describes it as a method for \"Editing Images with Following Instructions,\" allowing us to perform complex edits like \"make the lighting softer\" or \"give the skin a warmer tone\" that are difficult to achieve with simple filters. This handles the overall aesthetic.\n\n*   **Branch B: Parallel Face Specialists for Detail:** The core of the user's request is the detailed expression of \"Asian skin tones and facial expressions.\" This requires specialized models.\n    *   **CodeFormer for High Fidelity:** **CodeFormer** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11253)) is chosen for its \"robust blind face restoration\" capabilities. Its transformer-based architecture is excellent at discovering natural face components from a codebook, allowing it to restore realistic textures and details while maintaining high fidelity to the original person's identity. This directly addresses the sub-goals of **identity preservation** and **texture realism**.\n    *   **GFPGAN for High Quality:** **GFPGAN** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04061](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04061)) is included as a parallel, competitive option. Its strength lies in using a \"Generative Facial Prior\" from a pre-trained StyleGAN model to generate extremely high-quality, plausible, and aesthetically pleasing faces. While it excels at realism, this powerful prior can sometimes subtly shift the identity toward a more generic \"ideal.\" By offering this path alongside CodeFormer, the CNAPS workflow gives the user agency to balance pure fidelity with idealized quality, a crucial choice in commercial photography.\n\n*   **Intelligent Merging:** A simple linear pipeline (e.g., Input -> GFPGAN -> InstructPix2Pix) would be suboptimal. The face restorer might have its detailed work degraded by the subsequent global edit. By running them in parallel and then compositing the specialized face onto the globally edited image, we preserve the highest level of detail from each module.\n\n*   **Exclusion of Txt2"
