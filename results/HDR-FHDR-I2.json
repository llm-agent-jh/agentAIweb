    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **restore brightness information in outdoor photos where highlights are blown out (overexposed)**, recovering detail that appears completely white or washed out due to excessive lighting. \n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n- Structure preservation of underlying image features\n- Texture realism in recovered highlight areas\n- Maintaining natural lighting transitions between exposed and overexposed regions\n- Color accuracy restoration in blown-out areas\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes overexposed outdoor images through a **branching enhancement network** where the input image flows through multiple specialized pathways simultaneously. The **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** serves as the primary restoration module, while **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** handles atmospheric interference that often accompanies outdoor lighting issues. These modules work in parallel, with their outputs merged through adaptive weighting. A **quality assessment branch** analyzes the original image to determine optimal blending parameters. The system then performs **iterative refinement** where the merged result can be fed back through the enhancement pathway if highlight recovery is insufficient.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input**: RGB image with blown highlights\n- **Processing**: Adaptive brightness restoration with detail recovery\n- **Output**: Enhanced image with recovered highlight information\n- **Intermediate format**: Tone-mapped RGB with preserved dynamic range\n\n**Module 2: WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze**\n- **Input**: Original overexposed image\n- **Processing**: Atmospheric haze/glare removal that often accompanies outdoor overexposure\n- **Output**: Clarified image with reduced atmospheric interference\n- **Intermediate format**: Deglared RGB with improved contrast\n\n**Module 3: Adaptive Merger**\n- **Input**: Enhanced image + Deglared image + Quality metrics\n- **Processing**: Weighted blending based on local image characteristics\n- **Output**: Optimally combined result\n- **Intermediate format**: Blended RGB with region-specific weighting maps\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design addresses blown-out highlights through **complementary processing pathways**:\n\n1. **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** is repurposed for highlight recovery since overexposure and underexposure both involve dynamic range issues requiring similar adaptive enhancement techniques.\n\n2. **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** handles the atmospheric effects (glare, haze) that frequently cause or accompany outdoor overexposure, providing a cleaner base for highlight recovery.\n\n3. The **synaptic branching approach** allows parallel processing of different aspects of the overexposure problem, with adaptive merging ensuring optimal results across varying image regions.\n\n4. **Iterative refinement** enables the system to handle severely blown-out areas that may require multiple enhancement passes.\n\n**Note**: While **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** is available, it's not included in this workflow as blown-out highlights are primarily an exposure/dynamic range issue rather than a blur problem. The MSSNet paper focuses on motion blur restoration, which is not directly relevant to highlight recovery.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore brightness and detail in outdoor photos where highlights are blown out due to excessive light. This involves recovering lost information in overexposed regions without affecting the naturally exposed areas.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Highlight recovery without unnatural artifacts\n- Structural and color consistency\n- Minimal distortion to well-exposed regions\n- Natural-looking restoration\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system starts by analyzing the input to isolate blown-out areas using a brightness threshold. These regions are processed by a specialized enhancement path using `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`, repurposed to bring back contrast and suppress glare. Meanwhile, the rest of the image is left unchanged to preserve structure. Both paths are merged using the generated mask to restore blown-out highlights while retaining image integrity.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Why CLAIO-DeHaze?**  \n  Though not designed for highlight recovery, `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` handles glare and washed-out areas by restoring texture and color in high-brightness zones—behavior well-suited to repurposing for overexposed regions.\n\n- **Why Branching?**  \n  A single-path approach would overprocess areas that don’t need enhancement. The synaptic split isolates problematic zones and allows fine-grained recovery without harming well-exposed areas.\n\n- **Why Not Use Others?**  \n  - `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`: Brightens rather than recovers blown regions—counterproductive here.\n  - `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`: Targets motion blur, irrelevant to lighting issues ([MSSNet Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)).\n\nThis CNAPS-style system mimics selective neural routing—only activating pathways relevant to localized issues—ensuring efficient and realistic image correction.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform **overexposure correction** on outdoor photos. Specifically, they need to recover lost color and texture detail in \"blown-out highlights\"—areas of the image that are clipped to pure white due to excessive brightness.\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Highlight Recovery:** Restore plausible brightness, color, and texture information in clipped pixel regions.\n*   **Naturalism & Consistency:** Ensure the restored highlights blend seamlessly with the rest of the image, matching the overall lighting and color palette.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The correction process must not negatively affect the parts of the image that are already well-exposed.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThe core challenge here is that none of the provided models are explicitly designed for highlight recovery. Therefore, a creative, multi-path approach is necessary to repurpose a suitable model for a targeted effect. A simple linear pipeline would fail, as applying any of these models to the entire image would produce undesirable results.\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system begins by analyzing the input image to isolate the problem. It creates a \"highlight mask\" that identifies only the overexposed, blown-out regions. This mask acts as the first synaptic junction, splitting the workflow into two parallel paths.\n\n*   **Path A (Targeted Correction):** The overexposed regions, as defined by the mask, are sent to the `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` model. We repurpose this model because atmospheric haze and blown-out highlights share a key characteristic: they are bright, low-contrast areas that obscure detail. A dehazing algorithm, which works to darken these areas and increase local contrast, can effectively simulate the recovery of detail and color in a blown-out sky or on a reflective surface.\n*   **Path B (Preservation):** The original image, containing the well-exposed areas, is preserved and passed along this path without modification.\n\nFinally, the two paths converge at a merging synapse. The processed highlights from Path A are carefully blended back into the original image from Path B, using the highlight mask (with soft, feathered edges) to ensure a seamless and natural-looking composite. The output is a single, restored image where the highlights are corrected without altering the rest of the photo.\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is mandated by the constraints of the provided tools.\n\n1.  **Choice of `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`:**\n    The user's problem is overexposure, but no \"Highlight Recovery\" or \"Inverse Tone Mapping\" model is available. The `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` model is the only plausible choice. Its function is to remove atmospheric haze, which it accomplishes by identifying bright, washed-out regions and increasing their contrast and color saturation. This effect is functionally analogous to what is needed for blown-out highlights (e.g., a white sky). By repurposing this model, we can achieve a reasonable approximation of highlight recovery.\n\n2.  **Necessity of the CNAPS Branching Architecture:**\n    A simple linear pipeline (e.g., `Input -> DeHaze -> Output`) would be destructive. Applying the `DeHaze` model to the entire image would incorrectly darken and oversaturate the already well-exposed parts of the photo, ruining the overall image quality.\n    The synaptic branching design is therefore critical.\n    *   **Synapse 1 (Masking):** It intelligently isolates the problem area, ensuring that our \"off-label\" use of the `DeHaze` model is precisely targeted.\n    *   **Synapse 2 (Blending):** It ensures the correction is integrated back into the image naturally, fulfilling the sub-goals of consistency and structure preservation. This targeted, modular approach is the essence of a CNAPS workflow.\n\n3.  **Exclusion of Other Models:**\n    *   **`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`**: This model is explicitly designed to solve the *opposite* problem: it brightens dark, underexposed images. Using it here would worsen the blown-out highlights.\n    *   **`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`**: The user's request concerns lighting and exposure, not motion or focus issues. As confirmed by its paper ([`MSSNet.pdf`](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)), this model's sole purpose is image deblurring, making it irrelevant to the task of highlight recovery."
