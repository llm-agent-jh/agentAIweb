    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a low-resolution, blurry black and white photograph by enlarging it 3x while restoring clear facial outlines and background details**. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n\n- **Deblurring**: Remove motion blur or focus blur to restore sharp edges and details\n- **Super-resolution**: Upscale the image 3x while preserving and enhancing structural details like facial features and background textures\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input image flows through parallel processing paths that later merge. The input blurry low-resolution image first branches into two specialized processing streams: one focused on deblurring using MSSNet models, and another that prepares for super-resolution. The deblurring branch itself contains two parallel pathways (RealBlurJ and RealBlurR variants) that process different blur characteristics simultaneously. These deblurred outputs are then intelligently merged and fed into the super-resolution module (SISR-IMDN-3x) for final 3x upscaling. The network mimics biological neural processing where multiple specialized \"neurons\" (models) work in parallel before converging to produce the final enhanced image.\n\n### B.

Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ**\n- **Input**: 256x256 (or original size) blurry B&W image tensor\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with motion blur artifacts removed\n- **Specialization**: Optimized for Japanese dataset blur patterns, excels at camera shake\n\n**Module 2: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR**\n- **Input**: Same 256x256 blurry B&W image tensor (parallel processing)\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with focus blur artifacts removed  \n- **Specialization**: Optimized for realistic blur patterns, excels at depth-of-field blur\n\n**Module 3: Feature Merger**\n- **Input**: Two deblurred images from parallel MSSNet branches\n- **Output**: Single optimally deblurred image combining best features\n- **Process**: Pixel-wise comparison and selective blending based on local sharpness metrics\n\n**Module 4: SISR-IMDN-3x**\n- **Input**: Merged deblurred image at original resolution\n- **Output**: 3x upscaled image with enhanced details\n- **Specialization**: Information Multi-Distillation Network for 3x super-resolution\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic architecture** is justified by the complementary strengths of the available models:\n\n**MSSNet Parallel Processing**: The MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) demonstrates that different blur types require specialized handling. By running both RealBlurJ and RealBlurR variants in parallel, we capture different blur characteristics that may be present in old photographs - RealBlurJ handles motion blur from camera shake, while RealBlurR addresses focus blur from depth-of-field issues.\n\n**Sequential Deblur-then-Upscale**: The IMDN paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) shows that super-resolution works best on sharp input images. By deblurring first, we provide the SISR-IMDN-3x model with cleaner input, enabling it to better reconstruct high-frequency details like facial features and background textures.\n\n**Synapse-like Merging**: Rather than selecting one deblurred output, the merger acts like a biological synapse, combining signals from multiple sources to produce a stronger, more accurate result. This addresses the inherent uncertainty in old photograph degradation patterns.\n\nThis architecture ensures that **facial outlines and background details are preserved and enhanced** through specialized processing paths that converge intelligently, mimicking how biological neural networks process complex visual information.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enlarge a blurry, low-resolution black-and-white photo (e.g., of a grandmother) by 3x, with the goal of restoring facial outlines and background details with clarity.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Remove real-world blur typical of old photographs\n- Preserve structural integrity, especially facial contours\n- Restore background elements like textures and edges\n- Perform 3x super-resolution to enlarge the image clearly\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe blurry low-resolution black-and-white image first enters a synaptic gateway that detects the blur type. Based on the common properties of old photos, the system routes the image to `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`, which is specialized for real-world photographic blur. This deblurred result is then passed to the super-resolution module `SISR-IMDN-3x`, which upscales the image by 3× while preserving edge fidelity. The output is a sharp, high-resolution black-and-white restoration.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** is optimized for real-world depth-of-field and out-of-focus blur commonly found in vintage or handheld photos. Its multi-scale structure is ideal for recovering facial outlines and subtle gradients【515†source】.\n- **SISR-IMDN-3x** (Information Multi-Distillation Network) excels at efficient and high-fidelity 3x upscaling. It is particularly well-suited for monochrome imagery and structured detail recovery like hair strands and background texture【515†source】.\n- The **CNAPS-style architecture** ensures each model specializes in one task—blur removal vs. resolution enhancement—allowing independent processing with minimal interference, and then linear fusion for the final result.\n\nThis design mimics how the brain processes degraded visual stimuli: first identifying and correcting the source of distortion (blur), then interpreting and enhancing structure through localized information distillation.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow for the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a low-resolution, blurry, black-and-white photograph. This involves a **\"blind super-resolution\"** task, where the degradation (a combination of blur and low resolution) must be reversed to produce a high-quality, enlarged image.\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Enlargement:** The image dimensions must be increased by a factor of 3x.\n*   **Deblurring:** The inherent blur (likely from camera shake or poor focus in the original shot) must be removed.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Critical features like the \"facial outline\" must be restored with high fidelity.\n*   **Texture Realism:** The \"background\" should be clear and detailed, avoiding an overly smooth or artificial look.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first routes the input to the correct specialized deblurring module before proceeding to the super-resolution stage. This initial conditional routing is a key feature of a CNAPS architecture, ensuring the right tool is used for the specific type of degradation.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nIn natural language, the system operates as follows:\n\nThe low-resolution, blurry black-and-white photo flows into the system. It first hits a **conditional synaptic gate** that analyzes the nature of the blur. Since the input is an \"old photo,\" it contains authentic, real-world blur, not synthetic blur. The gate therefore routes the image to the **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** module, which is specialized for this exact scenario.\n\nThis first module focuses exclusively on removing the blur while keeping the image at its original low resolution. The output is a \"clean\" but still small image. This intermediate result is then passed to the next module in the chain, **SISR-IMDN-3x**. This second module performs a 3x single-image super-resolution, intelligently adding pixels to enlarge the image while preserving the sharp details recovered by the first module.\n\nThe final output is the 3x enlarged, deblurred, and restored black-and-white photograph. This sequential but conditionally-initiated process is superior to a naive single-step approach because it isolates and corrects for different types of degradation in the optimal order.\n\n---\n\n### B.
