The sub-goals include:\n- **Resolution enhancement**: Upscale from current resolution to 2x larger dimensions\n- **Deblurring**: Remove blur artifacts to improve clarity\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintain sharp game UI elements, borders, and text\n- **Detail recovery**: Restore fine details that may have been lost in the low-resolution capture\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system implements a **multi-path synaptic network** where the input screenshot flows through multiple specialized super-resolution branches simultaneously. The input is first preprocessed and then **branches into three parallel pathways**: one optimized for general image enhancement (IMDN), one for real-world degradation handling (Swin2SR), and one for robust real-world super-resolution (ResShift). Each branch processes the image with different architectural strengths—IMDN focuses on efficient feature extraction, Swin2SR leverages transformer attention for complex patterns, and ResShift handles realistic degradation patterns. The outputs from all three branches are then **merged through a weighted fusion mechanism** that combines their complementary strengths, with particular emphasis on preserving text clarity and UI elements. A final refinement stage ensures optimal 2x scaling and sharpness.\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to upscale a low-resolution, blurry game screenshot to twice its original size (2x). The primary success criteria are achieving high fidelity and clarity in specific image elements, which involves two main sub-goals:\n\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The borders of UI elements must be sharp and well-defined.\n*   **Text Legibility:** All text in the screenshot must be clear and readable.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input in parallel branches, each specialized for a different aspect of the restoration task. The results are then intelligently merged for a superior final output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single low-resolution, blurry game screenshot as input. The input is immediately routed down two parallel processing branches in a \"fork\" pattern.\n\n*   **Branch A (UI & Text Path):** This branch is optimized for structural integrity and text. It uses a lightweight, precise 2x upscaler (`SISR-IMDN-2x`) that excels at recreating clean lines and sharp edges, which are characteristic of UI elements and fonts in games. It avoids introducing complex, \"realistic\" textures that could corrupt the text.\n\n*   **Branch B (Scene Restoration Path):** This branch is designed to handle the \"blurry\" aspect of the game's rendered scene (the non-UI parts). It uses a more powerful model trained on complex, real-world degradations (`SISR-Swin2SR-Real-4x`). This model first upscales to 4x to recover maximum detail from the blurry areas and is then downscaled to the target 2x resolution.\n\nFinally, the outputs from both branches converge at a **Synaptic Fusion Module**. This module uses a simple heuristic mask (e.g., based on edge detection and high-contrast regions) to identify the UI and text areas in the image. It then performs a masked merge, combining the sharp UI from Branch A with the detailed scene from Branch B to produce a single, high-quality 2x output image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and Module Definitions**\n\nThis CNAPS design is justified by the principle of **specialization**. A single model often involves a trade-off between faithfully recreating sharp, artificial structures (like text) and generating plausible, realistic textures for blurry natural scenes. By using two specialized branches, we leverage the strengths of each model for the image content it is best suited for.\n\n*   **[Branch A: SISR-IMDN-2x]**\n    *   **Justification:** The user's primary goal is \"clear border and text.\" The **Information Multi-distillation Network (IMDN)** is described as a \"lightweight\" and efficient model ([`arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)). Its architecture focuses on distilling essential features without excessive computational overhead. This makes it ideal for recreating the clean, sharp, and often aliased lines of game UI and fonts, as it is less likely to hallucinate unwanted \"real-world\" textures that could degrade legibility. Its native 2x scale factor directly matches the user's request.\n    *   **Output:** `[Intermediate A]` - A 2x resolution PNG image where UI elements and text are expected to be sharp and artifact-free.\n\n*   **[Branch B: SISR-Swin2SR-Real-4x]**\n    *   **Justification:** To address the \"blurry\" screen, we need a model adept at handling complex degradation. **Swin2SR** is a powerful model based on the Swin Transformer V2, specifically designed for \"real-world image super-resolution\" ([`arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345`](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)). By upscaling to 4x, we allow the model more room to reconstruct fine details and textures in the game world itself (e.g., character models, environments). We then use a high-quality downsampling algorithm (like Lanczos) to reduce it to the target 2x resolution, which often produces a sharper and more stable result than upscaling directly to 2x with the same model.\n    *   **Output:** `[Intermediate B]` - A 2x resolution PNG image where the non-UI parts of the game scene are expected to be more detailed and less blurry.\n\n*   **[Synaptic Fusion Module]**\n    *   **Justification:** This is the core of the CNAPS architecture. A simple linear pipeline would force a choice between the two results. The fusion module allows us to combine the *best parts of both*. It takes the clean UI from Branch A and the detailed scene from Branch B and merges them. The mask can be generated by a simple heuristic analyzer that identifies high-contrast, sharp-edged regions (typical of UI/text) in the upscaled `Intermediate A` image."
