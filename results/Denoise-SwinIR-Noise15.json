The primary goal is denoising and deblurring with specific attention to natural scenery components.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Motion/blur artifact removal\n- Noise reduction while preserving natural textures\n- Enhancement of water surface details and reflections\n- Sky clarity restoration and cloud definition preservation\n- Maintaining realistic color gradients in sky and water\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **specialized restoration network** where the input blurred beach image flows through a primary deblurring pathway with conditional weather enhancement branches. The core **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** module handles the primary blur removal, while **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** provides atmospheric clarity enhancement specifically for sky regions. The workflow intelligently routes processing based on detected scene elements (sky vs. water vs. land) and merges results using content-aware blending to produce a cohesively restored beach scene.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR**\n- **Input:** RGB beach image (H×W×3)\n- **Function:** Multi-scale blur removal using real-world blur patterns\n- **Output:** Deblurred RGB image with preserved structural details\n- **Reference:** https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 2: WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** \n- **Input:** Sky-segmented regions from deblurred image\n- **Function:** Atmospheric haze removal and clarity enhancement\n- **Output:** Enhanced sky regions with improved visibility and contrast\n- **Trigger:** Conditional activation when sky regions show haze/atmospheric distortion\n\n**Module 3: Content-Aware Fusion**\n- **Input:** Base deblurred image + Enhanced sky regions\n- **Function:** Seamless blending using gradient-domain techniques\n- **Output:** Unified restored beach scene\n\n---\n\n## 3. Workflow Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages **MSSNet's multi-scale architecture** (from the provided paper) which is specifically trained on real-world blur patterns, making it ideal for natural beach photography where motion blur and atmospheric effects are common. The **branching to weather removal** addresses the user's specific mention of sky clarity, as beach scenes often suffer from atmospheric haze that standard deblurring cannot fully address.\n\nThe **synaptic nature** comes from the conditional sky enhancement branch that only activates when atmospheric distortion is detected, mimicking how biological neural networks selectively activate pathways based on input characteristics. This prevents over-processing of already clear sky regions while ensuring comprehensive restoration of degraded atmospheric elements.",
    "llm_b": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore blurred daytime beach scenery photos by focusing on clarity in the **sea water** and **sky**.  \nThe main goal is removing motion blur and atmospheric noise while maintaining realism and natural textures.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Remove motion blur and camera shake artifacts\n- Reduce atmospheric haze/noise\n- Preserve details like sea textures and sky gradients\n- Ensure natural color tones\n- Apply restoration selectively to relevant regions\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is passed through a multi-branch pipeline designed to target different types of degradation: motion blur and atmospheric haze. The system routes the input to two specialized modules in parallel:\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** focuses on correcting motion blur across the image.\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** is conditionally applied to sky regions if haze is detected.\n\nA semantic segmentation step identifies 'sky', 'sea', and 'land' regions to guide fusion. After each specialized module processes its respective regions, a **content-aware fusion module** blends them into a single restored image.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis workflow uses **MSSNet** for robust multi-scale deblurring, ideal for removing real-world motion blur in beach scenes. The **DeHaze module** targets hazy sky regions that are common in beach photography.\n\nThe **segmentation module** ensures that enhancement is region-specific: the sky gets dehazed, the sea gets deblurred, and all parts are blended smoothly. This mimics a biological synaptic response, activating only the relevant pathways.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the optimal CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform targeted image restoration on a daytime beach photograph that suffers from both blur and noise. The primary goal is to enhance the visual quality and clarity, with a specific focus on making the **sea water** and **sky** look sharp and realistic.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Removing motion blur or camera shake.\n*   **Dehazing/Clarity Enhancement:** Removing atmospheric haze that reduces contrast and color vibrancy, often mistaken for general blurriness.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Ensuring that the natural shapes of waves, clouds, and the horizon are maintained.\n*   **Region-Specific Enhancement:** Applying the most effective restoration technique to the appropriate semantic regions (sky, water, sand).\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis problem involves two distinct types of degradation: physical blur (motion/focus) and atmospheric degradation (haze). A simple linear pipeline (e.g., Dehaze then Deblur) is suboptimal, as the first model can introduce artifacts that hinder the second. A CNAPS-style parallel workflow allows specialized models to tackle each problem independently before their outputs are intelligently integrated.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins by taking the single blurry input image and routing it down three parallel \"synaptic\" branches simultaneously:\n\n1.  **Deblurring Path:** The image is sent to the **Deblur-MSSNet** model to specifically correct for motion or camera shake, restoring sharp edges and fine details.\n2.  **Clarity Path:** The image is sent to the **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** model to remove atmospheric haze, which is common in beach scenes and is crucial for restoring the color and contrast of the sky and distant sea.\n3.  **Guidance Path:** A lightweight **Semantic Segmentation** module (a common architectural component for context-aware systems) analyzes the input image to create a map identifying the 'sky', 'water', and 'other' (e.g., sand, people) regions. This mask does not alter the image itself but acts as a critical guidance signal for the final merge step.\n\nThese three branches work in parallel. The outputs—a deblurred image, a dehazed image, and a semantic mask—converge at a **Synaptic Merge Node**. This node uses the semantic mask to perform a weighted, region-aware fusion of the two restored images. For example, it will favor the dehazed result for the sky and the deblurred result for foreground elements, creating a final, high-quality image that leverages the strengths of both restoration models.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS design is directly informed by the user's request and the specific capabilities of the provided models.\n\n*   **Model Selection:**\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** is chosen because the user explicitly mentions the image is \"blurred.\" The model's paper, \"[Multi-Scale Semantic Network for Deblurring](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf),\" confirms its specialization in removing complex motion blur. Its \"Multi-Scale Semantic\" nature implies it is already designed to handle different image structures effectively, making it ideal for the varied textures of a beach scene.\n    *   **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze** is chosen because \"daytime scenery,\" especially over water, often suffers from atmospheric haze. This causes a loss of clarity and color saturation that users perceive as blur. This model directly targets this degradation, which is critical for restoring a \"clear\" sky and sea, as requested.\n    *   **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain** is **explicitly excluded**. The user describes a \"daytime beach scene\" with blur and noise, with no mention of rain. Applying a de-raining model would be irrelevant and risks introducing unnecessary artifacts.\n\n*   **CNAPS Architecture Rationale:**\n    *   **Parallel Branches:** Blur and haze are fundamentally different problems. A deblurring model seeks to reverse a motion kernel, while a dehazing model estimates and removes an atmospheric veil. Processing them in parallel prevents one model from corrupting the input for the other. This synaptic approach ensures that each specialized model operates on the original, untainted input data.\n    *   **Semantic Guidance:** The user’s request is not generic; it specifically highlights the **\"sea water and the sky.\"** The Guidance Path with a semantic segmenter directly addresses this. It provides the crucial context needed at the **Synaptic Merge Node** to apply the right fix to the right place. The dehazed image's clear, vibrant sky can be blended with the deblurred image's sharp foreground details. This targeted fusion is far superior to a simple global filter or a linear chain. This approach is inspired by the \"Semantic Network\" concept in the MSSNet paper, extending it to the architectural level for multi-model fusion."
