    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance storefront photographs by adjusting lighting and brightness to create a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere. This involves **low-light image enhancement** with specific attention to creating even illumination that makes the storefront appear more inviting to potential customers.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Brightness normalization and enhancement\n- Shadow detail recovery\n- Highlight preservation to avoid overexposure\n- Color temperature adjustment for warmth/comfort\n- Maintaining structural integrity of architectural elements\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **hybrid enhancement-generation network** where the original storefront image flows through two parallel processing branches that later merge. The **primary branch** uses direct low-light enhancement to improve the existing image while preserving its authentic characteristics. The **secondary branch** generates an idealized version using text-to-image synthesis to establish optimal lighting targets. A **merging module** combines insights from both branches to produce the final enhanced storefront with comfortable, even lighting.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Image Analysis & Preprocessing**\n- **Input:** Raw storefront photograph\n- **Process:** Analyze lighting conditions, identify shadow/highlight regions\n- **Output:** Preprocessed image + lighting analysis metadata\n\n**Module 2A: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input:** Preprocessed storefront image\n- **Process:** Direct low-light enhancement preserving original structure\n- **Output:** Enhanced version maintaining authentic storefront details\n\n**Module 2B: Text-to-Image Reference Generation**\n- **Input:** Text prompt: \"well-lit comfortable storefront, even lighting, warm atmosphere, professional photography\"\n- **Models:** Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-SimpleMix OR Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-LemonTeaMix\n- **Process:** Generate idealized storefront lighting reference\n- **Output:** Reference image with optimal lighting characteristics\n\n**Module 3: Adaptive Merging & Refinement**\n- **Input:** Enhanced original + Generated reference\n- **Process:** Extract lighting patterns from reference, apply selectively to enhanced original\n- **Output:** Final storefront with improved lighting and comfortable atmosphere\n\n---\n\n## 3. Workflow Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic design** leverages the strengths of both direct enhancement and generative modeling:\n\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** provides the foundation by improving the actual storefront image while preserving its authentic architectural details and context.\n\n- **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-SimpleMix/LemonTeaMix** serves as a \"lighting consultant,\" generating reference images that demonstrate optimal lighting conditions for comfortable storefronts.\n\n- The **branching structure** allows parallel processing where enhancement and generation inform each other, rather than operating in isolation.\n\n- The **merging phase** acts as a synaptic integration point, combining real enhancement with idealized lighting guidance to achieve the user's goal of \"comfortable atmosphere\" and \"even lighting.\"\n\nThis approach ensures both photographic authenticity and atmospheric optimization, addressing the user's specific requirements for storefront presentation.",
    "llm_b": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to adjust storefront photos to create a warm, comfortable atmosphere by evenly enhancing the lighting and brightness.  \nSub-goals include:\n- Even lighting without overexposure\n- Preservation of structural and architectural details\n- Recovery of shadow information while maintaining realism\n- Aesthetic tuning (color warmth, visual comfort)\n- No hallucination or object manipulation\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture enhances storefront images through a two-branch synaptic structure:  \n- One branch applies **direct low-light enhancement** using the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` model to brighten the photo while preserving real-world details.  \n- The second branch leverages **text-to-image synthesis** (e.g., `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-SimpleMix`) using prompts like “a cozy, warm, well-lit storefront” to generate an idealized lighting reference.  \n\nThese two outputs are merged in a final **adaptive refinement module** that selectively transfers lighting cues from the reference image to the enhanced real image, creating a final image that is both realistic and visually optimized.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\n**Branch A: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**  \n- Performs direct low-light enhancement to brighten dark regions, recover shadows, and avoid overexposure.\n- Ensures the storefront retains architectural accuracy.\n- Works especially well when no paired high-quality reference exists.\n\n**Branch B: Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-SimpleMix (or LemonTeaMix)**  \n- Generates a high-quality visual reference with ideal lighting.\n- Prompt example: “well-lit storefront with cozy, welcoming lighting.”\n- Output guides the tonal balance and atmosphere.\n\n**Merging Module: Adaptive Lighting Refinement**  \n- Combines structural integrity from the real photo with warmth/atmosphere from the synthetic reference.\n- Uses selective transfer techniques to avoid hallucination or distortion.\n- Avoids replacing the original photo; instead, applies enhancement informed by the synthetic reference.\n\nThis design balances **realism (Branch A)** with **aesthetic idealization (Branch B)**, merging them in a **goal-aware, synaptic structure**. It leverages the generative reference as a guidance signal, not a replacement, aligning fully with CNAPS principles.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform image enhancement on existing storefront photos. The primary goal is to adjust the lighting and brightness to make the photos look more inviting and create a \"comfortable atmosphere,\" ensuring the adjustments are applied evenly across the image.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Lighting & Brightness Adjustment:** The core technical task is to increase brightness in dark or underexposed areas.\n*   **Atmosphere Creation:** The enhancement should not be purely technical; it must achieve a subjective aesthetic goal (\"comfortable\"), which implies warmth and pleasantness, not just clinical brightness.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The original architecture, signage, and details of the storefront must be perfectly preserved. The model should not add or remove objects.\n*   **Realism & Detail Preservation:** The final image must look like a real, well-taken photograph. Textures, edges, and fine details should be enhanced, not washed out or blurred.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a \"generate-and-test\" synaptic network. The system takes a single input image and routes it to a specialized enhancement module. Instead of producing one \"correct\" output, this module **branches out**, generating a small set of enhanced candidates with varying intensity levels. These parallel outputs are then passed to a second, entirely different type of module—a multimodal scoring model. This scoring model acts as a \"synaptic junction,\" receiving inputs from all branches. It uses a natural language description of the desired aesthetic (\"comfortable atmosphere\") to evaluate each candidate. Finally, the system makes a decision, selecting the candidate that best matches the aesthetic goal and presenting it as the final output. This branching and evaluative merging is the hallmark of a CNAPS-style system, moving beyond a simple linear pipeline to a more robust, goal-aware process.\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis workflow is meticulously designed based on the capabilities and principles of the provided resources.\n\n#### **Module 1: Image Enhancement (Zero-DCE)**\n\n*   **Model/Paper Choice:** The `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` model, underpinned by the **Zero-DCE (Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation)** paper ([arXiv:2001.06826](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06826)), is the ideal choice.\n*   **Justification:**\n    1.  **Direct Task Alignment:** The user's request to \"adjust the lighting and brightness evenly\" is the exact problem Zero-DCE is designed to solve. It enhances images by estimating a pixel-wise, higher-order curve to adjust the dynamic range. This \"curve-based\" adjustment ensures a smooth and even transformation, preventing the blocky artifacts common with naive methods.\n    2.  **Structure & Detail Preservation:** The Zero-DCE paper emphasizes its ability to preserve image details and avoid over/under-exposed regions. This directly supports the sub-goals of structure preservation and realism. It modifies pixels rather than hallucinating new content.\n    3.  **Branching Capability:** Zero-DCE is not a black box. The learned curves can be parameterized. This allows us to intentionally generate multiple outputs (subtle, medium, strong) by slightly varying the parameters that control the enhancement effect, creating the necessary branches for our CNAPS workflow.\n\n#### **Module 2: Aesthetic Quality Scoring & Selection (CLIP)**\n\n*   **Model/Paper Choice:** This module's logic is enabled by the principles described in the **CLIP (Learning Transferable Visual Models From Natural Language Supervision)** paper ([arXiv:2103.00020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00020)).\n*   **Justification:**\n    1.  **Solving Subjectivity:** The user's goal of a \"comfortable atmosphere\" is subjective and cannot be measured by simple metrics like brightness (PSNR) alone. CLIP excels at bridging this gap between visual data and human language.\n    2.  **Automated Decision-Making:** By using a text prompt like \"A storefront photo with a comfortable, warm, and welcoming atmosphere,\" we can use a CLIP-based model to score how well each enhanced candidate from Module 1 aligns with this abstract concept. The branch that produces the image with the highest CLIP similarity score is deemed the \"best\" result.\n    3.  **Synaptic Integration:** This module acts as the synapse where multiple parallel information streams (the candidate images) are integrated and evaluated against a guiding signal (the text prompt) to produce a single, coherent action (the final selection). This is the critical step that elevates the system from a simple pipeline to an intelligent workflow.\n\n#### **Excluded Models**\n\n*   **`Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-SimpleMix` & `LemonTeaMix`:** These models, based on the **Stable Diffusion** paper, were explicitly excluded. They are text-to-image *synthesis* models. Using them would generate a *new*, completely different storefront based on a text prompt. This would fundamentally violate the user's intent to *adjust their existing photos* and fail the critical sub-goal of \"structure preservation.\" They are the wrong tool for this enhancement task."

    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This response is the clear winner by a significant margin. It demonstrates a superior understanding of both the user's constraints and the provided tools. Its \"generate-and-test\" workflow is a more sophisticated and practical application of CNAPS principles. It cleverly uses one model to generate multiple candidate branches and then uses the principles of another provided resource (the CLIP paper) to create a concrete, implementable selection module that directly addresses the subjective goal of \"comfortable atmosphere.\" Its reasoning for *excluding* the text-to-image models is sharp, accurate, and shows a deep level of task understanding.
