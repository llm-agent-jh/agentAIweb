CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe workflow begins with user input: a living room image and target recoloring instructions (e.g., \"sofa: red\", \"chair: green\"). First, semantic segmentation is applied to isolate each object. Each object is then routed through its own branch where grayscale conversion and color application occurs via `Colorization-DISCO-c0_2`.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow for the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform **selective object recoloring** on an input image of a living room. The goal is to change the color of specific items—the sofa, desk, chair, window, and carpet—while ensuring the final image looks realistic and coherent.\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Object Segmentation:** The system must first identify the precise pixel boundaries of each target object.\n*   **Color Application:** A new, distinct color must be applied to each segmented object.\n*   **Structure & Texture Preservation:** The original texture, material properties, and fine details (e.g., fabric weave, wood grain) of the objects must be retained.\n*   **Lighting & Shadow Cohesion (Harmonization):** The newly colored objects must blend seamlessly back into the original scene's lighting environment, correctly adopting existing shadows and highlights.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first requires a **prerequisite segmentation step** to isolate the target objects. It then branches into parallel processing streams for each object before merging them sequentially back into the main image canvas.\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's living room image and a list of target objects as input. The first critical step, which we will define as a prerequisite `Module 0`, is to generate segmentation masks for each object (sofa, desk, etc.).\n\nOnce the masks are created, the workflow **branches out**. The main branch holds the background image (the original photo with the target objects removed). In parallel, a new branch is created for each object to be recolored. Within each of these parallel branches, the isolated object is converted to grayscale to separate its structure from its color. Then, the `Colorization-DISCO` model is used to apply a new color, treating the grayscale object as \"content\" and a simple color swatch as the \"style.\"\n\nAfter all objects are recolored in their separate branches, the workflow begins a **sequential merging process**. One by one, each newly colored object is composited back onto the background image. Crucially, after each object is placed, the `Harmonization-INR-RAW` model is triggered. This model acts as a synapse, adjusting the lighting, tone, and color of the newly added object to make it perfectly consistent with the rest of the scene. This process repeats until all objects have been added and harmonized, resulting in a single, photorealistic final image.\n\n#### **B.
