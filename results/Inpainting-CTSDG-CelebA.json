Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblurring Branch (MSSNet-J & MSSNet-R)**\n- **Input**: RGB facial image (H×W×3)\n- **Function**: Parallel processing with two MSSNet variants trained on different blur types\n- **Output**: Two deblurred candidates + confidence scores\n- **Reference**: MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)\n\n**Module 2: Inpainting Branch (ResShift-Face)**\n- **Input**: Original blurry image + damage mask (auto-detected or manual)\n- **Function**: Facial structure restoration, eyebrow reconstruction, contour enhancement\n- **Output**: Inpainted facial features with preserved identity\n- **Reference**: ResShift paper (https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/2ac2eac5098dba08208807b65c5851cc-Paper-Conference.pdf)\n\n**Module 3: Fusion Node**\n- **Input**: Best deblurred result + inpainted features\n- **Function**: Intelligent blending using facial landmarks and quality metrics\n- **Output**: Unified restored image with enhanced contours, eyebrows, and skin texture\n\n---\n\n### D. Justification\n\nThis **synaptic design** leverages the strengths of each model:\n\n1. **MSSNet's dual-branch approach** (RealBlurJ/RealBlurR) handles different blur kernels and motion patterns common in facial photography, as demonstrated in their paper's evaluation on real-world blur datasets.\n\n2. **ResShift-Face's specialized facial inpainting** excels at reconstructing facial structures while maintaining identity consistency, crucial for restoring natural contours and eyebrows as mentioned in the NeurIPS paper.\n\n3. **Branching allows parallel processing** of deblurring and inpainting, reducing total processing time while enabling specialized optimization for each restoration aspect.\n\n4. **The fusion strategy** prevents artifacts that could occur from sequential processing, ensuring the final output maintains both sharpness and structural integrity.\n\nThis architecture addresses the user's specific needs: blur removal (MSSNet), facial structure restoration (ResShift), and natural appearance preservation (fusion strategy).",

This avoids overprocessing and respects fine features while enhancing the flawed areas.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, here is a detailed breakdown and design for a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform a high-fidelity restoration of a representative's face from an image that has both global and local defects. The goal is to produce a natural-looking, sharp, and complete facial image.\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove motion or focus blur from the entire face.\n*   **Flaw Correction/Inpainting:** Reconstruct specific areas that are corrupted, missing, or severely flawed (e.g., artifacts, patches of bad skin).\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the person's identity and the natural shape of their facial features (\"natural facial contour\").\n*   **Texture Realism:** Synthesize fine, high-frequency details like skin pores and individual eyebrow hairs (\"eyebrows, and skin texture\").\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network with two main parallel processing branches that are intelligently merged at the end.\n\nThe system takes a single **flawed input image** and a **user-provided flaw mask** (indicating the specific regions to inpaint). The input image is immediately routed down two parallel paths:\n\n1.  **Global Deblurring Branch:** The entire image is sent to the **Deblur-MSSNet** module. This branch is responsible for correcting the overall blurriness of the face. A preliminary analysis could even select between the `RealBlurJ` (for JPEG artifacts) and `RealBlurR` (for realistic motion/camera blur) variants for optimal results, though for this design we will assume `RealBlurR` is more suitable for general facial blur. This branch produces a globally sharpened version of the face.\n\n2.  **Local Inpainting Branch:** The original flawed image, along with the flaw mask, is sent to the **Inpainting-ResShift-Face** module. This model focuses *only* on the masked regions (the \"flaws\"). Its specialization on faces ensures it can realistically reconstruct complex features like eyebrows and skin texture from scratch, preserving the person's identity. This branch produces a version of the image where only the flawed areas have been perfectly restored.\n\nFinally, a **Synaptic Fusion** step occurs. The system uses the original flaw mask to composite the outputs from the two branches. The globally sharpened image from the deblurring branch is used as the base, but the areas corresponding to the mask are replaced with the superior, targeted reconstructions from the inpainting branch. This ensures we get the best of both worlds: global sharpness and high-fidelity local repairs, resulting in a single, coherent, and natural-looking final image.\n\n### B.

Justification of Design Choices\n\nThis CNAPS-style, multi-branch design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because it treats distinct problems with specialized models in parallel, preventing error accumulation and leveraging the unique strengths of each component.\n\n1.  **Parallel Branches for Specialized Tasks:** The user's request identifies two different problems: \"blurry\" (a global, low-frequency issue) and \"flaws\" (a local, high-integrity issue).\n    *   **Deblurring Branch:** For the \"blurry\" problem, **Deblur-MSSNet** is the ideal choice. As described in its paper ([https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)), it is a multi-stage network specifically designed for \"fast and accurate image deblurring.\" Using this model globally provides a sharp, coherent base image. We select `RealBlurR` as it is trained on realistic blur, which is common in photos of people.\n    *   **Inpainting Branch:** For the \"flaws,\" simply deblurring is insufficient. These areas require complete reconstruction. **Inpainting-ResShift-Face** is perfectly suited for this. Its paper ([https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/2ac2eac5098dba08208807b65c5851cc-Paper-Conference.pdf](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/2ac2eac5098dba08208807b65c5851cc-Paper-Conference.pdf)) highlights its ability to handle large masks and its specialization on faces (\"-Face\"). This ensures that when it reconstructs \"eyebrows\" and \"skin texture,\" it does so in a semantically aware manner that preserves the identity and realism of the face, a critical sub-goal.\n\n2.  **Synaptic Fusion for Optimal Combination:** A simple pipeline (e.g., Deblur -> Inpaint) would force the inpainting model to work on an already-processed image, which might contain subtle artifacts from the deblurring step. Our synaptic design avoids this by having the inpainting model work on the *original* image data for the flawed regions, ensuring the highest possible fidelity. The **Synaptic Fusion Module** then intelligently composites the results. This masked blending is the crucial \"synapse\" that combines the outputs, using the sharp result from the deblurrer everywhere *except* for the flawed regions, where it uses the perfectly reconstructed patches from the inpainter. This directly achieves all user goals: the restored \"facial contour\" comes from the deblurrer, while the high-detail \"eyebrows, and skin texture\" in the flawed areas come from the inpainter."
