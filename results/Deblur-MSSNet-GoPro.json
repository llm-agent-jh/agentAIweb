    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a blurry, motion-shaken nighttime photograph to produce a clear, sharp image. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Motion deblurring**: Removing blur artifacts caused by camera shake during capture\n- **Low-light enhancement**: Improving visibility and quality of the dark nighttime scene while preserving natural appearance\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-pathway synaptic network** where the input image flows through two specialized branches that process different degradation aspects simultaneously. The blurry night image enters both a motion deblurring pathway and a low-light enhancement pathway. The deblurring branch uses MSSNet models to analyze and remove motion artifacts, while the enhancement branch processes the low-light characteristics. These pathways operate in parallel initially, then merge through a weighted fusion mechanism that intelligently combines the strengths of both processed outputs. The system can adaptively route between different MSSNet variants (RealBlurR vs RealBlurJ) based on blur characteristics, creating conditional branching within the deblur pathway.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **MSSNet architecture** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) which uses multi-scale strip convolutions specifically designed for motion deblurring. The dual-variant approach (RealBlurR/RealBlurJ) allows adaptive processing based on image characteristics, as MSSNet variants are optimized for different blur scenarios.\n\nThe **parallel processing approach** is justified because motion blur and low-light degradation are independent phenomena that can be addressed simultaneously without interference. The synaptic branching allows each specialized module to focus on its domain expertise while the fusion stage intelligently combines results.\n\nThe **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** addresses the specific challenge of nighttime imagery where traditional deblurring alone would not restore the full scene visibility. This creates a synergistic effect where deblurring removes motion artifacts while enhancement reveals scene details obscured by darkness.",

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a single image that suffers from two distinct degradations: **motion blur** (from being \"shaken\") and **poor lighting conditions** (from being a \"night view\").\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove the blur caused by camera or subject motion to restore sharp edges and details.\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** Increase brightness, improve contrast, and restore color fidelity without amplifying noise.\n*   **Artifact Suppression:** Ensure the restoration process does not introduce new visual artifacts like ringing, checkerboard patterns, or blotchy noise.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the original composition and geometry of the scenery.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a \"pre-process, branch, and fuse\" network. The input, a blurry and dark image, does not go through a simple linear pipeline. Instead, it is first routed to a **low-light enhancement module**. This is a critical first step because deblurring algorithms perform significantly better on well-lit images where edges and structures are more discernible from noise.\n\nAfter enhancement, the now-brighter (but still blurry) image is sent down **two parallel synaptic branches**. Each branch contains a specialized deblurring model from the MSSNet family: one trained on general, in-the-wild blurs (`RealBlurJ`) and the other on realistic rendered blurs (`RealBlurR`). This parallel processing allows the system to hedge its bets, as one model may outperform the other depending on the specific nature of the blur in the user's photo.\n\nFinally, the outputs from both deblurring branches are sent to a **Quality-based Fusion module**. This module acts as the network's integration point, analyzing both restored images to select the superior one or intelligently merge them to produce a single, high-quality final image. This output is the clear, well-lit restoration of the user's original photo.\n\n### B.

Module Definitions\n\n#### **Module 1: Low-Light Enhancement**\n*   **Model Used:** `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`\n*   **Purpose:** To pre-process the input image by correcting for poor lighting. This module increases the global brightness, enhances local contrast, and improves color saturation. Crucially, it provides a cleaner, more information-rich input for the subsequent deblurring modules.\n*   **Input:** The original user-provided image (e.g., `input_shaken_night.jpg`).\n*   **Processing:** The model analyzes the image's luminance and color channels to produce an enhanced version.\n*   **Output:** An image that is well-lit and color-corrected, but still blurry (e.g., `intermediate_enhanced.png`).\n\n#### **Branch A: Deblur Module (Generalist)**\n*   **Model Used:** `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`\n*   **Purpose:** This is the primary deblurring branch. The `RealBlurJ` model is trained on a dataset of real-world blurry photos captured \"in the wild,\" making it robust for the unpredictable, complex motion blurs typical of a \"shaken\" handheld photo.\n*   **Input:** The enhanced intermediate image (`intermediate_enhanced.png`).\n*   **Processing:** The Multi-Stage Splitting Network (MSSNet) architecture iteratively refines the deblurred result, effectively estimating and removing the complex blur kernel.\n*   **Output:** A deblurred version of the image (e.g., `output_deblurred_J.png`).\n\n#### **Branch B: Deblur Module (Specialist)**\n*   **Model Used:** `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`\n*   **Purpose:** This branch acts as a specialized alternative. The `RealBlurR` model is trained on a dataset with realistic blurs generated via a rendering pipeline. It may excel if the camera shake resulted in a smoother, more uniform motion path. Running it in parallel provides a chance for a better result on specific types of blur.\n*   **Input:** The enhanced intermediate image (`intermediate_enhanced.png`).\n*   **Processing:** Same MSSNet architecture as Branch A, but with different learned weights from the `RealBlurR` dataset.\n*   **Output:** A second, alternative deblurred version of the image (e.g., `output_deblurred_R.png`).\n\n#### **Module 3: Quality-based Fusion**\n*   **Model Used:** This is a conceptual architectural component representing a decision or merging logic, not a single pre-trained model from the list. It could be implemented using no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metrics or a small, trained selection model.\n*   **Purpose:** To intelligently integrate the results from the parallel deblurring branches. It prevents the system from having to guess which branch was better and delivers a single, optimized final result to the user.\n*   **Input:** The two deblurred images from the parallel branches (`output_deblurred_J.png` and `output_deblurred_R.png`).\n*   **"
