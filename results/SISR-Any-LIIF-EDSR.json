Core Task\nThe user wants to achieve **7.5x image super-resolution** with specific emphasis on preserving and enhancing architectural details—particularly building exterior textures and window corner sharpness. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation (maintaining geometric accuracy of building features)\n- Texture realism (enhancing surface details without artifacts)\n- Edge sharpness (crisp window corners and architectural lines)\n- Blur mitigation (addressing potential motion/focus blur in the original photo)\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input photo flows through multiple specialized pathways simultaneously. The input first branches into two parallel streams: one for deblurring analysis and another for super-resolution preprocessing. The deblurring branch uses dual MSSNet models to handle different blur types commonly found in architectural photography. These outputs then merge with the super-resolution pathway, where RCAN performs iterative 2x upscaling to achieve the target 7.5x magnification. The final synthesis combines the deblurred structural information with the super-resolved texture details through adaptive weighting based on local image characteristics.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Blur Detection & Branching**\n- **Input:** Original photo (H×W×3)\n- **Output:** Blur type classification + confidence scores\n- **Function:** Analyzes motion patterns and focus characteristics to route to appropriate MSSNet variant\n\n**Module 2A: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR**\n- **Input:** Photos with realistic motion blur\n- **Output:** Deblurred image (H×W×3) + structural edge map\n- **Activation:** When motion blur detected\n\n**Module 2B: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ**\n- **Input:** Photos with JPEG compression artifacts + blur\n- **Output:** Deblurred image (H×W×3) + artifact-reduced features\n- **Activation:** When compression artifacts detected\n\n**Module 3: Feature Merger**\n- **Input:** Deblurred results + original texture analysis\n- **Output:** Enhanced base image (H×W×3) with preserved architectural details\n- **Function:** Adaptive weighting based on local image confidence\n\n**Module 4: SISR-RCAN Iterative Chain**\n- **Input:** Enhanced base image (H×W×3)\n- **Iteration 1:** 2x upscaling → (2H×2W×3)\n- **Iteration 2:** 2x upscaling → (4H×4W×3)  \n- **Iteration 3:** 2x upscaling → (8H×8W×3)\n- **Scale Adjustment:** Downsample to 7.5x → (7.5H×7.5W×3)\n\n**Module 5: Architectural Detail Enhancement**\n- **Input:** 7.5x scaled image\n- **Output:** Final enhanced photo with sharp window corners and texture details\n- **Function:** Post-processing to emphasize building-specific features\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\n**MSSNet Selection (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf):**\nThe dual MSSNet approach addresses the reality that architectural photography often contains mixed blur types—motion blur from handheld shooting and compression artifacts from image processing. The branching allows specialized handling of each blur type before merging.\n\n**RCAN Iterative Approach (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11279):**\nRCAN's residual channel attention mechanism is particularly effective for architectural imagery because it preserves fine structural details while enhancing textures. The iterative 2x approach (2x→4x→8x→7.5x) maintains better quality than a single large upscaling factor.\n\n**Synaptic Design Rationale:**\nThe branching structure mimics how human vision processes architectural scenes—simultaneously analyzing structure, texture, and clarity before integrating these elements. This parallel processing approach prevents information loss that would occur in a linear pipeline.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enlarge a photograph of a building by a factor of 7.5x while restoring the clarity of architectural textures and window corners. The process must ensure realistic texture generation, sharp structural preservation, and clean up of any blur before upscaling.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Detect and remove real-world blur (motion or compression artifacts)\n- Preserve and enhance building edges, windows, and surface textures\n- Perform precise, high-quality 7.5x super-resolution\n- Avoid artifacts during extreme scaling\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe original image flows into two deblurring branches in parallel: one using `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` and the other `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`, each targeting different real-world blur types. The two outputs are passed to a quality gate that selects the cleaner result. The selected deblurred image is then fed into the super-resolution model `SISR-RCAN-it-2x` iteratively in three loops to reach 8x. Finally, a downscaling module reduces the result to the requested 7.5x size while maintaining fidelity.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** and **RealBlurJ** are designed to correct real-world blur patterns from natural photos and JPEGs respectively. Running both in parallel enables a synaptic-style error-resilient correction system【419†source】.\n- **SISR-RCAN-it-2x** (Residual Channel Attention Network) is state-of-the-art for structure-aware image super-resolution. Its multi-pass application preserves fine building geometry across extreme magnification levels【421†source】.\n- The **Quality Gate** uses perceptual metrics to select the best deblurred candidate, avoiding amplification of residual noise.\n- The **Synaptic Design** reflects biological systems: blur-specific parallel processing, merging into attention-aware enhancement, then post-hoc correction to meet user-specified scale without compromising quality.\n\nThis architecture ensures detailed, high-resolution results while intelligently addressing upstream image flaws through branching and merging CNAPS modules.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the optimal CNAPS-style workflow to fulfill the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform high-fidelity Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) on a photograph of a building. The primary goal is to enlarge the image by a factor of 7.5x while ensuring the final output has realistic, sharp details, specifically focusing on the building's surface textures and the clean, angular geometry of its window corners.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n*   **Blur Removal:** The input image is likely blurry due to camera shake or focus issues, which must be corrected before upscaling.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The sharp, geometric lines of the building and windows must be maintained and sharpened, not rounded or distorted.\n*   **Texture Synthesis/Restoration:** The model must realistically generate fine details for materials like brick, concrete, or glass.\n*   **Precise Scaling:** The final output must be exactly 7.5 times the dimensions of the original input.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network. It begins with a parallel branching path for pre-processing (deblurring) and then funnels the best result into a sequential, iterative loop for the main task (super-resolution), followed by a final adjustment step.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe process begins when the low-resolution input image enters the system. Because the type of blur in the image is unknown (e.g., motion blur vs. focus blur), the system immediately **branches** the input to two specialized deblurring models, `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` and `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`, which run in parallel. Each model produces a candidate deblurred image.\n\nThese two outputs then **merge** at a \"Quality Gate\" module. This module programmatically assesses which of the two images has superior sharpness and fewer artifacts, selecting the best one for the next stage.\n\nThe selected, deblurred image then enters an **iterative loop**. The super-resolution model, `SISR-RCAN-it-2x`, can only upscale by a factor of 2x per pass. To achieve the target magnification, the model is applied sequentially three times, taking the output of one pass as the input for the next (1x -> 2x -> 4x -> 8x).\n\nFinally, this 8x upscaled image undergoes a high-quality downsampling process to precisely match the user's requested 7.5x magnification, producing the final, restored image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification**\n\nHere is a step-by-step justification for each module in the workflow, referencing the provided materials.\n\n**1. Input Node: `[ Input Image (1x) ]`**\n*   **Description:** The user's original, low-resolution photograph of the building.\n*   **Format:** Standard image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG).\n\n**2. BRANCH: Deblurring (`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` & `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`)**\n*   **Purpose:** To remove blur from the input image before attempting super-resolution. Applying SR to a blurry image often magnifies the blur and leads to poor results. This pre-processing step is critical for achieving sharp final details.\n*   **Models Used:** `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` and `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`.\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   The **MSSNet** (Multi-Stage Splitting Network) architecture is explicitly designed for \"blind image deblurring,\" meaning it can handle complex, real-world blurs without knowing the specific blur kernel ([Paper: MSSNet](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)). This is ideal for user-submitted photos.\n    *   The **synaptic branching** to two models (`RealBlurR` and `RealBlurJ`) is a key strength. These models are trained on different real-world blur datasets (RealBlur-R and RealBlur-J). By processing the image with both, we increase the probability of finding a model that is well-suited to the specific type of blur present in the user's image, maximizing restoration quality.\n*   **Intermediate Output:** Two deblurred images at the original 1x resolution.\n\n**3. MERGE: Quality Gate**\n*   **Purpose:** To programmatically select the superior result from the deblurring branch.\n*   **Description:** This module takes the two deblurred images as input. It uses a no-reference image quality assessment algorithm (e.g., calculating sharpness via Laplacian variance or a BRISQUE score) to determine which image has better edge clarity and fewer artifacts. It then passes only the winning image to the next stage.\n*   **Justification:** This merge point is essential in a CNAPS workflow. It prevents propagating errors or suboptimal results from one branch and ensures the super-resolution stage receives the best possible input, directly impacting the final quality of textures and corners.\n*   **Intermediate Output:** The single best deblurred image at 1x resolution.\n\n**4. LOOP: Iterative Super-Resolution (`SISR-RCAN-it-2x`)**\n*   **Purpose:** To perform the core image enlargement.\n*   **Model Used:** `SISR-RCAN-it-2x`.\n*   **Justification:**\n    *   **RCAN** (Residual Channel Attention Network) is a state-of-the-art SISR architecture known for its ability to model interdependencies between channels, allowing it to recover fine-grained, high"
