    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to transform a product image into a high-resolution illustration with clear lines and enhanced details. This involves **style transfer from photographic to illustration aesthetic** while maintaining the product's structural integrity and enhancing visual clarity through super-resolution.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation of the original product\n- Style conversion to illustration aesthetic with clear lines\n- Resolution enhancement for high-quality output\n- Detail enhancement and sharpening\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like network** where the input product image flows through multiple specialized modules that work in parallel and sequence. The workflow branches into two primary pathways: a **style transformation branch** and a **resolution enhancement branch**. \n\nThe input image first gets processed by two Stable Diffusion models working in parallel - one optimized for realistic rendering (majicMix) and another for refined illustration output (Reliberate). These models generate different stylistic interpretations simultaneously. The outputs then merge through a conditional selection mechanism that chooses the best illustration-style result. Finally, the selected output flows to the super-resolution module (SISR-IMDN) to enhance details and achieve high-resolution quality.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: SD-majicMix-realistic**\n- **Input:** Original product image + illustration-style prompt\n- **Process:** Image-to-image generation with realistic base model\n- **Output:** Illustration-style image with realistic foundation\n- **Prompt Example:** \"high-resolution illustration of [product], clear lines, detailed artwork, vector art style\"\n\n**Module 2: SD-Reliberate**  \n- **Input:** Original product image + illustration-style prompt\n- **Process:** Image-to-image generation with refined artistic model\n- **Output:** Stylized illustration with enhanced artistic quality\n- **Prompt Example:** \"professional illustration of [product], clean lines, high detail, commercial art style\"\n\n**Module 3: Quality Comparison & Selection**\n- **Input:** Output A and Output B from SD models\n- **Process:** Automated quality assessment based on line clarity and detail preservation\n- **Output:** Selected best illustration result\n\n**Module 4: SISR-IMDN-3x**\n- **Input:** Selected illustration image\n- **Process:** Super-resolution enhancement using lightweight deep network\n- **Output:** High-resolution illustration with enhanced details\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **synapse-like branching principle** by utilizing multiple Stable Diffusion models in parallel, each bringing different strengths to illustration generation. The majicMix-realistic model provides a strong foundation for maintaining product accuracy, while Reliberate offers enhanced artistic refinement.\n\nThe **SISR-IMDN-3x model** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) is specifically chosen for its lightweight architecture that efficiently enhances image resolution while preserving fine details - crucial for achieving the \"clear lines and details\" requirement. The paper demonstrates superior performance in single image super-resolution with reduced computational complexity.\n\nThe workflow's **conditional merging mechanism** ensures optimal output selection, while the final super-resolution stage guarantees high-quality results that meet the user's specifications for detailed, high-resolution illustrations."
