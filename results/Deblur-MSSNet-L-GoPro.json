    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\nThe user wants to restore a blurry street photo affected by camera shake (hand tremors) and low-light conditions into a clear, detailed image. The sub-goals include: motion blur removal, detail enhancement, structure preservation, and noise reduction while maintaining photorealistic quality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system processes the input through a **synapse-like branching network** where the blurry night photo is simultaneously analyzed by multiple specialized deblurring modules. Each MSSNet variant handles different types of blur degradation patterns. The system branches into three parallel processing paths: synthetic motion blur handling (GoPro), real-world blur with complex degradation (RealBlurR), and joint deblurring-denoising for low-light conditions (RealBlurJ). These branches process the image concurrently, then their outputs are intelligently merged through a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that selects the best regions from each restoration, producing a final enhanced image with preserved details and reduced artifacts.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Branch 1: MSSNet-L-GoPro**\n- **Input**: RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **Function**: Handles synthetic motion blur patterns, optimized for camera shake\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with motion artifacts removed\n- **Intermediate**: Multi-scale feature maps, blur kernel estimations\n\n**Branch 2: MSSNet-RealBlurR**  \n- **Input**: RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **Function**: Processes real-world blur with complex degradation patterns\n- **Output**: Naturally deblurred image preserving realistic textures\n- **Intermediate**: Real blur pattern analysis, adaptive restoration maps\n\n**Branch 3: MSSNet-RealBlurJ**\n- **Input**: RGB image (H×W×3)  \n- **Function**: Joint deblurring and denoising for low-light conditions\n- **Output**: Deblurred + denoised image optimized for night photography\n- **Intermediate**: Noise estimation maps, joint restoration features\n\n**Fusion Module**:\n- **Input**: Three restored images + confidence maps\n- **Function**: Pixel-wise weighted combination based on local quality metrics\n- **Output**: Final enhanced image combining best aspects of each branch\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Multi-Scale Stripformer Network (MSSNet)** architecture from the referenced paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf). The three variants address different aspects of the complex degradation:\n\n- **MSSNet-L-GoPro** handles the primary motion blur from hand tremors\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurR** addresses real-world blur complexities in street photography  \n- **MSSNet-RealBlurJ** tackles the joint challenge of blur and noise in low-light conditions\n\nThe synapse-like branching allows parallel processing of different degradation types, while the fusion mechanism ensures optimal detail preservation. This approach is superior to sequential processing as it maintains multiple solution paths and combines their strengths, directly addressing the paper's emphasis on handling diverse real-world blur scenarios through multi-scale strip attention mechanisms.",

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow designed to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a blurry, noisy photograph taken at night, which suffers from motion blur caused by hand tremors.\n\nThe sub-goals are:\n*   **Motion Deblurring:** To counteract the effects of camera shake.\n*   **Noise & Artifact Reduction:** To handle the degradations common in low-light photography (e.g., sensor noise, color shifting, compression artifacts).\n*   **Detail & Structure Restoration:** To recover fine textures and sharp edges in the street scene, making the final image look clear and realistic.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow employs a parallel-processing design where the input image is routed to two specialized modules simultaneously. The outputs are then intelligently merged at a \"synaptic\" node to produce a final result that is superior to what either module could achieve alone.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's blurry night photo as input. This single input \"signal\" is immediately split and sent down two parallel branches, activating two different AI \"neurons\" (models).\n\n*   **Branch A (Primary Restoration):** This path uses the `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ` model. This model is trained on real-world blurry JPEGs, making it an expert at handling the complex, non-uniform blur and digital artifacts (like noise and compression) common in a user's night photo. Its job is to produce a stable, robustly deblurred image that serves as the foundation for the final output.\n\n*   **Branch B (Detail Guidance):** This path uses the `Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro` model. This model is trained on the synthetic GoPro dataset, which features clean motion blur without the added complexity of real-world sensor noise. While it may struggle with the noisy aspects of the input, it excels at identifying and restoring sharp, high-frequency details from the motion blur itself. Its output will serve as a \"detail map\" or guide.\n\n*   **Merge Synapse (Guided Fusion):** The outputs from both branches converge at a merge node. Instead of a simple average, the system performs a guided fusion. It calculates the \"detail difference\" between the two outputs and intelligently adds the extra sharpness from the *Detail Guidance* branch onto the stable foundation of the *Primary Restoration* branch.\n\nThis synaptic merge ensures we get the best of both worlds: the artifact-resistance of the `RealBlurJ` model and the fine-detail recovery of the `GoPro` model. The final output is a single, clear, and richly detailed restored image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is specifically designed to overcome the compound challenges of the user's request by leveraging the distinct specializations of the provided models.\n\n1.  **Why a Branching (CNAPS) Structure?**\n    A single linear pipeline is insufficient because the input image has multiple, conflicting degradations: motion blur and real-world noise/artifacts. The `MSSNet` paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) shows that performance is highly dependent on the training dataset. By branching, we can apply models trained on different data distributions to tackle different aspects of the problem in parallel, a core principle of robust, synaptic AI systems.\n\n2.  **Justification for Branch A: `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`**\n    *   **Relevance:** The user's input is a \"blurry street photo,\" implying it was captured by a consumer camera or phone and saved as a JPEG.\n    *   **Evidence:** The `MSSNet` paper describes the `RealBlur` dataset as containing images with \"realistic blur\" from real cameras. The `-J` variant is specifically for JPEG images. This makes `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ` the ideal model for producing a globally coherent and artifact-free base restoration, as it has been trained on the exact type of degradation present in the input. It will be more resilient to the photo's inherent noise and compression.\n\n3.  **Justification for Branch B: `Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro`**\n    *   **Relevance:** The user specifies blur from \"hand tremors,\" which is a form of motion blur.\n    *   **Evidence:** The `GoPro` dataset is a standard benchmark for motion deblurring, created by averaging high-framerate video frames. The `Deblur-MSSNet-GoPro` model is therefore a specialist in reversing motion blur on a structural level. While it may not handle the night-time noise well, its output is valuable as a source of high-frequency edge and texture information that it can recover from the motion vectors. It acts as our \"detail expert.\"\n\n4.  **Justification for the Guided Fusion Synapse**\n    *   **Problem:** Simply averaging the two outputs would dilute their respective strengths. We would mix the noise-handling of `RealBlurJ` with the potential artifacts of `GoPro`, and the sharpness of `GoPro` with the potential softness of `RealBlurJ`.\n    *   **Solution:** The proposed merge logic (`Final = Output A + (α * DetailMap)`) is a form of guided enhancement. It uses the robust `Output A` as a non-negotiable base and only adds the *difference* in detail"
