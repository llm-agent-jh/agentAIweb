Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a blurry nighttime image containing streetlights and text/letters by applying 3x zoom while improving clarity and sharpness**. \n\nSub-goals include:\n- **Motion/blur removal** from the original image\n- **Low-light enhancement** to improve visibility of night scene details\n- **Super-resolution/upscaling** to achieve 3x zoom\n- **Text/letter legibility improvement** for any signage or street markers\n- **Light source detail preservation** to maintain streetlight structure\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system receives a blurry nighttime image and routes it through a **branching synaptic network** where specialized modules work in parallel and sequence. The input first branches into two parallel paths: one focuses on **deblurring** while the other handles **low-light enhancement**. These parallel streams process different aspects of image degradation simultaneously. The deblurred and enhanced outputs then **merge** through a fusion layer that intelligently combines the best features from both paths. Finally, the merged result flows into a **super-resolution module** that performs the 3x upscaling while preserving the enhanced details from previous stages.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Branch A - Deblur Module (MIMO-UNet-RealBlur)**\n- **Input**: Original blurry nighttime image\n- **Processing**: Multi-scale motion blur removal using coarse-to-fine approach\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with sharp streetlight edges and text contours\n- **Paper Reference**: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf\n\n**Branch B - Low-Light Enhancement Module**\n- **Input**: Original blurry nighttime image (parallel processing)\n- **Processing**: Brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, noise reduction\n- **Output**: Enhanced image with improved visibility of dark regions\n\n**Fusion Layer**\n- **Input**: Deblurred image + Enhanced image\n- **Processing**: Weighted pixel-wise combination preserving sharp features from Branch A and brightness from Branch B\n- **Output**: Combined image with both sharpness and proper illumination\n\n**Super-Resolution Module (MIMO-UNet-Plus)**\n- **Input**: Fused enhanced image\n- **Processing**: 3x upscaling with detail preservation specifically tuned for text and light sources\n- **Output**: Final 3x zoomed image with clear streetlights and legible text\n- **Paper Reference**: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis **synaptic branching approach** is optimal because:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: The MIMO-UNet architectures from the Cho et al. paper demonstrate superior performance in handling multiple degradation types simultaneously, making parallel deblurring and enhancement feasible.\n\n2. **Specialized Modules**: Each branch addresses specific degradation (blur vs. low-light) rather than attempting to solve everything in one model, following the multi-scale approach proven effective in the ICCV 2021 paper.\n\n3. **Information Preservation**: The fusion layer prevents information loss that would occur in a linear pipeline, ensuring both sharpness and brightness are maintained.\n\n4. **Scalable Architecture**: The MIMO-UNet-Plus variant provides the super-resolution capability needed for 3x zoom while maintaining the enhanced features from previous stages.\n\nThis design leverages the **coarse-to-fine methodology** from the referenced paper while adapting it to a multi-module synaptic network that can handle the complex requirements of nighttime image enhancement with zoom.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a **blurry nighttime image containing streetlights and text** by performing a **3× zoom** while improving **clarity, brightness, and sharpness**.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Motion or defocus blur removal\n- Low-light enhancement to reveal text and detail\n- 3× upscaling with structure and edge preservation\n- Clarity of streetlights and signage\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input blurry night image is processed through **two parallel enhancement paths**:\n\n- **Path A** applies **deblurring first** using `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-Plus`, then runs `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` to brighten dark regions.\n- **Path B** applies **low-light enhancement first**, followed by `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur` to deblur the already brightened image.\n\nBoth results are evaluated using **text recognition confidence (OCR)** and **image quality scores (BRISQUE)**. The winning image is selected and passed through a final **3× super-resolution upscaling** step using the MIMO-UNet super-resolution variant (3× capable) to produce the final clean zoomed output.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-Plus** is used in Branch A as the front-end blur corrector due to its coarse-to-fine architecture that captures large motion blur patterns effectively before enhancement【707†source】.\n- **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** in Branch B is run after illumination because real-world noise can become clearer post-enhancement, which benefits blur removal【707†source】.\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** boosts contrast, suppresses noise, and enhances dark regions—critical for low-light visibility.\n- The **evaluation module** (e.g., EasyOCR + BRISQUE) ensures that the final image is selected not just on theoretical quality but on how well real-world text and light structures were restored.\n- The **final 3× upscaling** uses a tailored MIMO-UNet variant capable of retaining detail at higher resolutions, aligning with the user's zoom-in request.\n\nThis CNAPS-style system mimics cognitive reasoning by using **parallel hypotheses**, **performance-based selection**, and **final perceptual scaling**, yielding an optimized image with clear light sources and readable text at 3× zoom.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a single, blurry, low-light image of a night scene containing streetlights and text. The primary goal is to improve the clarity and legibility of all elements, specifically the lights and letters, by deblurring the image and then upscaling it by a factor of 3x.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove the blurriness from the image, particularly around light sources and text.\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** Correct for the poor lighting conditions of a night scene without introducing excessive noise or artifacts.\n*   **Super-Resolution:** Increase the image resolution by 3x to \"zoom in.\"\n*   **Detail Restoration:** Ensure that fine details, especially the structure of lights and the shapes of letters, are sharp and recognizable in the final output.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first analyzes the input image to determine its properties, then routes it through parallel processing branches to test different restoration strategies, and finally uses an evaluation module to select the best path before producing the final output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins when the user's input image enters the system. Instead of a fixed pipeline, the image is first sent to two parallel **classifier modules**: one to detect the scene type (\"night\") and another to detect image degradation (\"blur\").\n\nIf the image is confirmed to be both blurry and a night scene (the user's case), the system activates two parallel **restoration branches** to determine the optimal order of operations, a common challenge in image restoration.\n*   **Branch 1** first applies the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` and then feeds that result into the `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-Plus` model.\n*   **Branch 2** does the reverse: it first deblurs the image with `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-Plus` and then applies the low-light enhancement.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches are then sent to an **evaluation synapse**. This stage uses two different models to score the quality of each result. The `Image-Text-Recognition-EasyOCR` model attempts to read text in each image, providing a direct measure of letter clarity. Concurrently, the `Image-Quality-Assessment-BRISQUE` model provides a general, no-reference quality score. The system selects the image that yields better text recognition results, using the BRISQUE score as a tie-breaker.\n\nFinally, this winning intermediate image is passed to the **super-resolution module** (`Super-Resolution-NTIRE-2020-x4`) to be upscaled. Since the model provides 4x magnification and the user requested 3x, a final downsampling step is applied to meet the exact requirement. The result is a clear, 3x-zoomed image that directly addresses the user's request.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture is explicitly designed for robustness and quality by leveraging conditional routing and parallel processing, inspired by how neural systems handle complex stimuli.\n\n1.  **Analysis Synapse (Input Routing):**\n    *   **Models Used:** `Image-Classifier-Scene-Detector`, `Image-Classifier-Blur-Noise`.\n    *   **Justification:** A simple linear pipeline would apply the same steps to every image. A CNAPS-style network first understands the input. By using these classifiers, the system confirms the user's description (\"blurry,\" \"at night\") and routes the image to the appropriate specialized modules. This avoids unnecessary processing and is the foundation of an intelligent, branching workflow.\n\n2.  **Parallel Restoration Branches:**\n    *   **Models Used:** `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`, `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-Plus`.\n    *   **Justification:** The optimal order for enhancement and deblurring is not always known. Enhancing first can amplify noise that"
