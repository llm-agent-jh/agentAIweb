    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance low-quality mobile phone photos by upscaling them to 2x resolution while simultaneously removing compression artifacts and restoring image clarity**. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Resolution enhancement**: Increasing image dimensions by 2x while preserving structural details\n- **Artifact removal**: Eliminating compression artifacts, blur, and noise to restore natural image quality\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like enhancement network** where the input low-quality mobile photo is processed through multiple specialized pathways that address different aspects of image degradation. The workflow branches into two parallel processing streams: one focused on super-resolution and another on deblurring/artifact removal. These streams process the image simultaneously, then their outputs are intelligently merged to produce a final enhanced image that combines the benefits of both approaches.\n\nThe key innovation is that instead of sequential processing (which can compound errors), the system uses **parallel processing with cross-stream information sharing**, allowing each module to benefit from the other's intermediate results before final fusion.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Branch A - Super-Resolution Path:**\n- **Model**: SISR-IMDN-2x\n- **Input**: Original low-quality image (e.g., 512×384)\n- **Output**: 2x upscaled image (1024×768) with enhanced details\n- **Reference**: [IMDN Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) - Information Multi-distillation Network for efficient super-resolution\n\n**Branch B - Deblurring Path:**\n- **Model**: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR\n- **Input**: Original low-quality image\n- **Output**: Deblurred image at original resolution with reduced artifacts\n- **Reference**: [MSSNet Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) - Multi-Scale Separable Network for real-world blur removal\n\n**Fusion Strategy:**\nThe adaptive fusion module combines:\n1. **Structural information** from the super-resolved image (Branch A)\n2. **Clean texture details** from the deblurred image (Branch B, upscaled to match dimensions)\n3. **Confidence maps** generated by each branch to weight the contribution of each pathway\n\n---\n\n### D. Workflow Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design is optimal because:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: The SISR-IMDN-2x and MSSNet-RealBlurR models address complementary aspects of image degradation simultaneously, preventing error accumulation from sequential processing.\n\n2. **Model Specialization**: \n   - SISR-IMDN-2x excels at 2x super-resolution with its information multi-distillation approach\n   - MSSNet-RealBlurR is specifically trained on real-world blur scenarios typical of mobile photography\n\n3. **Synergistic Enhancement**: The fusion module leverages the strengths of both branches - the structural coherence from super-resolution and the artifact-free quality from deblurring.\n\n4. **Efficiency**: The Information Multi-distillation Network (IMDN) provides efficient super-resolution, while MSSNet's multi-scale approach handles various blur types common in mobile photos.\n\nThis synaptic architecture ensures that the final output achieves both the desired 2x resolution increase and comprehensive artifact removal, addressing the user's complete requirements.",

Justification\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-2x** (Information Multi-Distillation Network) provides fast and high-quality 2x super-resolution. It is known for producing clear edges with minimal artifacts, making it ideal for the user’s enlargement goal【588†source】.\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** is designed to handle real-world blur and artifact degradation, especially effective against compression and noise distortions【588†source】.\n- The **parallel processing** approach ensures that the SR and artifact removal happen independently to avoid one distorting the other. This parallelism mimics synaptic multi-pathway integration in perception.\n- The **Fusion Module** merges the best of both worlds: the upscaling strength of IMDN and the clarity restoration of MSSNet.\n\nThis CNAPS system delivers a visually clean, structurally enhanced 2x image from degraded mobile photo input.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a compound image restoration task on low-quality mobile phone photos. The primary goal is to achieve a 2x super-resolution (enlargement) while simultaneously removing visual degradations, specifically the compression artifacts common in saved mobile photos (e.g., JPEG artifacts).\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Artifact Removal:** Eliminate blockiness, color banding, and ringing artifacts caused by compression.\n*   **Resolution Enhancement:** Increase the image dimensions by a factor of 2x.\n*   **Detail Restoration:** Realistically restore fine details and textures, especially in critical regions like human faces.\n*   **Identity Preservation:** For photos containing people, the restored faces must maintain the original person's identity.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first analyzes the input and then routes it through specialized, parallel processing paths before merging the results for a final, high-quality output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system begins by receiving a low-quality input image. Instead of a simple linear process, it first employs a **synaptic switch**: a **Face Detector** module. This module analyzes the image to see if it contains human faces.\n\n1.  **Branching:**\n    *   **If no faces are detected**, the workflow proceeds down a simple, direct path focused on general image restoration. The image is processed by **SwinIR** to remove compression artifacts and then again by **SwinIR** to perform a 2x super-resolution.\n    *   **If faces are detected**, the workflow splits into two parallel branches to handle the background and faces separately, ensuring each part receives the best possible treatment.\n\n2.  **Parallel Processing (Face Path):**\n    *   **Background Branch:** The entire image is sent to the **SwinIR** model, which is excellent at general restoration. It first removes compression artifacts from the entire scene and then upscales it to 2x resolution. This creates a high-quality, enlarged background.\n    *   **Face Branch:** The cropped facial regions are sent to **CodeFormer**, a specialized blind face restoration model. CodeFormer restores facial details with remarkable realism and upscales the faces, leveraging its powerful codebook of facial priors.\n\n3.  **Merging/Integration:**\n    The outputs from the parallel branches are then recombined. The high-quality, restored faces from CodeFormer are seamlessly blended back into the upscaled background from SwinIR. A final blending step ensures there are no visible seams, resulting in a single, coherent, high-resolution image where both the background and faces are restored to the highest quality.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Detailed Justification and Module Breakdown**\n\nThis CNAPS design is built upon the unique strengths of the provided models, creating a system where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n*   **Synaptic Switch (Face Detector)**\n    *   **Role:** This initial step is the core of the CNAPS architecture. It makes an intelligent decision that dictates the entire subsequent workflow. By detecting faces, it allows us to apply a \"divide and conquer\" strategy, routing facial regions to a specialized expert model.\n    *   **Justification:** A general restoration model might produce acceptable faces, but a specialized model will almost always produce superior results. This branching prevents the \"one-size-fits-all\" limitation of linear pipelines.\n\n*   **Module: SwinIR**\n    *   **Paper:** [SwinIR: Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257)\n    *   **Role:** SwinIR is the workhorse for general-purpose restoration and upscaling in this workflow. It is used in two key stages: removing compression artifacts and performing super-resolution.\n    *   **Justification:** The SwinIR paper demonstrates its state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks, including **JPEG Compression Artifact Reduction** and **Image Super-Resolution**. Its Swin Transformer architecture is highly effective at capturing long-range dependencies in an image, making it ideal for removing the blocky, widespread artifacts of compression and then intelligently adding detail during upscaling. It forms the backbone of our \"general restoration\" path and the \"background\" branch of our face restoration path.\n\n*   **Module: CodeFormer**\n    *   **Paper:** [Towards Robust Blind Face Restoration with Codebook Lookup Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11253)\n    *   **Role:** CodeFormer is the specialized expert for the face restoration branch. It takes the low-quality, cropped faces and restores them with high fidelity and realism.\n    *   **Justification:** The user wants clear restoration. For faces, this is a non-trivial task. The CodeFormer paper explains its unique approach: it uses a \"codebook\" of discrete, high-quality facial components and a Transformer to map the degraded input to these clean priors. This allows it to restore severely degraded faces while preserving identity. Its controllable fidelity feature (the `w` parameter) is a key architectural advantage, allowing a balance between \"quality\" (a more idealized face) and \"fidelity\" (staying true to the original input), which is crucial for meeting user expectations. It vastly outperforms general models like SwinIR on the specific domain of faces.\n\n*   **Module: Blending Module**\n    *   **Role:** This final module is critical for integrating the outputs of the parallel branches. It pastes the restored faces"
