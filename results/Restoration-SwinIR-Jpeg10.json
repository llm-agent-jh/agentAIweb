The goal is to enhance image quality while maintaining photorealistic characteristics of urban nighttime scenes.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Remove compression-induced blur artifacts\n- Preserve structural details of buildings and architecture\n- Maintain natural light characteristics (street lights, neon signs, window illumination)\n- Ensure texture realism without over-sharpening or introducing artifacts\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input night city image flows through multiple specialized pathways that address different aspects of image degradation simultaneously. The workflow branches into two parallel enhancement streams: one focused on **low-light enhancement** to recover details lost in dark regions, and another focused on **deblurring** to remove compression artifacts. These streams process the image independently, then their outputs are intelligently merged through a **multi-scale fusion approach** that preserves the best characteristics from each pathway. The system uses conditional routing to determine the optimal combination weights based on local image characteristics (bright vs. dark regions, blur severity).\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input**: Raw night city image (RGB, various resolutions)\n- **Processing**: Recovers details in dark regions, enhances visibility of building structures\n- **Output**: Enhanced image with improved visibility in shadows and dark areas\n- **Intermediate Format**: Enhanced RGB image with preserved light characteristics\n\n**Module 2: MSSNet-RealBlurR (Primary Deblurring)**\n- **Input**: Same raw night city image\n- **Processing**: Multi-scale blur removal using real-blur training data\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with sharp structural details\n- **Reference**: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 3: MIMO-UNet-RealBlur (Secondary Deblurring)**\n- **Input**: Output from MSSNet for refinement\n- **Processing**: Multi-input multi-output architecture for fine-grained deblurring\n- **Output**: Refined deblurred image with enhanced edge preservation\n- **Reference**: https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf\n\n**Module 4: Multi-Scale Fusion**\n- **Input**: Enhanced image from Module 1, deblurred image from Module 3\n- **Processing**: Adaptive fusion based on local image characteristics\n- **Output**: Final restored night city image combining enhanced details and sharp structures\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic design** is optimal for night city photo restoration because:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: The MSSNet and MIMO-UNet papers demonstrate that real-blur datasets are crucial for handling compression artifacts in natural images. Running deblurring in parallel with low-light enhancement prevents one process from interfering with the other.\n\n2. **Multi-Scale Approach**: The MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) shows that multi-scale processing is essential for handling varying blur kernels, which is perfect for compression blur that affects different frequency components differently.\n\n3. **Sequential Refinement**: The MIMO-UNet paper (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) demonstrates that coarse-to-fine approaches work better than single-stage methods, justifying the MSSNet → MIMO-UNet sequence.\n\n4. **Synaptic Fusion**: Rather than a simple linear pipeline, the branching and merging design allows the system to preserve the best aspects of both enhancement and deblurring, crucial for maintaining natural light characteristics in night scenes.",

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS workflow enables robust night photo restoration through parallel specialized modules:\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** removes structural-level blur using multi-stage refinement【275†source】.\n- **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** adds fine-grained deblurring and preserves textures across scales【275†source】.\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** brightens the scene and reveals building details and shadows.\n- The **multi-scale fusion module** intelligently integrates detail-rich and structure-sharp paths to avoid overexposure or artificial sharpness.\n\nThis design mimics how human vision combines luminance and edge detection for clarity in low-light conditions.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore low-quality, compressed night city photographs. The primary goal is to remove blur artifacts while ensuring the final image appears natural, specifically concerning the rendering of building structures and light sources (e.g., streetlights, windows).\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove compression and motion/focus blur.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the geometric integrity and straight lines of buildings.\n*   **Light Realism:** Render light sources without excessive glow, halos, or color shifting.\n*   **Low-Light Fidelity:** Enhance details in dark areas without introducing significant noise or artifacts.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that explores multiple restoration strategies in parallel and then converges on the optimal result. It avoids a single, rigid pipeline, which might fail if its initial assumptions (e.g., \"deblur first\" vs. \"enhance first\") are incorrect for a given image.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single low-quality night city photo as input. This input signal immediately branches into two primary, parallel pathways:\n\n1.  **Deblur-First Pathway:** This path assumes the primary degradation is blur. The input image is fed simultaneously into two different state-of-the-art deblurring models, **MIMO-UNet** and **MSSNet**. These models run in parallel, each producing a deblurred version of the image. This sub-branching leverages their architectural differences to generate two distinct, high-quality candidates.\n\n2.  **Enhance-First Pathway:** This path hypothesizes that improving the low-light conditions first might help the deblurring models perform better. The input image is first processed by the **low-light-img-enhancer**. The resulting brightened (but still blurry) image is then fed, in parallel, into the same two deblurring models, **MIMO-UNet** and **MSSNet**.\n\nAt this point, the system has generated four distinct candidate images. These four candidates are converged into a **Quality Assessment & Selection Module**. This module programmatically analyzes all four results against the original input, scoring them on metrics like sharpness, structural similarity (to preserve buildings), and highlight clipping (to ensure natural lights). The candidate with the highest score, best balancing all sub-goals, is selected as the final, clean output image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is explicitly chosen to handle the ambiguity inherent in image restoration. A simple linear pipeline would be brittle.\n\n1.  **Parallel Deblurring Models (MIMO-UNet & MSSNet):**\n    The user's primary complaint is \"blur.\" We use two different, powerful deblurring models in parallel because they have fundamentally different architectures, which may excel on different types of content.\n    *   **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur:** The paper ([Rethinking Coarse-To-Fine Approach in Single Image Deblurring](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)) highlights its multi-input multi-output U-Net structure. This is excellent for preserving features across multiple scales, which is critical for maintaining the fine details of \"buildings\" and the sharp edges of \"lights.\"\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR:** The paper ([Multi-Stage Splitting Network for Single Image Deblurring](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) describes a multi-stage network that progressively deblurs the image. This iterative approach can be highly effective for complex, real-world blur kernels like those found in compressed night photos.\n    *   By running both, we increase the probability of getting a superior result, as one may handle the specific blur in the user's photo better than the other.\n\n2.  **Branching for Order of Operations (Deblur-First vs. Enhance-First):**\n    The \"night city\" context is crucial. It's unclear whether it's better to deblur a dark image or to brighten an image first, which might amplify blur/compression artifacts.\n    *   The **Deblur-First Pathway** directly tackles the primary complaint.\n    *   The **Enhance-First Pathway** uses the **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** to test the hypothesis that deblurring models perform better with improved visibility. This is a critical \"what-if\" scenario that a linear pipeline would miss. For an image that is extremely dark, this path is likely to produce the superior result.\n\n3.  **Convergence with a Quality Assessment Module:**\n    This is the core of the CNAPS architecture. With four candidate images, a decision must be made. A simple merge (e.g., averaging) would likely degrade the quality. The **Quality Assessment Module** acts as the final \"synapse,\" integrating the results. It would evaluate candidates based on:\n    *   **Sharpness Metrics (e.g., Laplacian variance):** To ensure the image is actually deblurred.\n    *   **Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):** To ensure building geometry is preserved relative to the original.\n    *   **Highlight/Shadow Analysis:** To check that the \"natural lights\" goal is met and that enhancement hasn't created blown-out highlights or crushed blacks.\n    This selection process ensures the final output is not just a technically processed image, but the one that best aligns with the user's qualitative goals."
