CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch inpainting network** that processes structural and textural restoration simultaneously before intelligent merging. The input restaurant image flows into two specialized branches: one focused on large structural completion (tables, furniture) and another on fine textural repair (walls, surfaces). Each branch uses different inpainting models optimized for their specific tasks. The outputs are then intelligently merged using a quality-aware fusion mechanism that preserves the best aspects of each restoration approach, ensuring seamless integration of structure and texture while maintaining lighting consistency throughout the scene.\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the optimal CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a complex image completion task on a restaurant interior photograph. This involves both **outpainting** (extending the scene where tables are cut off) and **inpainting** (repairing damaged walls), ensuring the final result is seamless and realistic.\n\nThe key sub-goals are:\n*   **Structural Plausibility:** Generating new scene geometry (tables, chairs, floor, walls) that is consistent with the existing perspective and layout.\n*   **Texture & Material Realism:** Reconstructing the textures of repaired walls and new objects to match the original materials (e.g., wood grain, paint finish, fabric).\n*   **Lighting & Shadow Coherence:** Ensuring that the lighting, shadows, and highlights in the newly generated areas perfectly match the ambient lighting conditions of the original photo.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis problem is ill-suited for a simple linear pipeline because it involves two distinct types of completion: large-scale structural generation and fine-grained texture repair. A synaptic, branching workflow allows us to use specialized models in parallel and integrate their strengths for a superior result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins with the user's input photo. A masking module first identifies two distinct regions of interest: **(A)** the large, peripheral areas that need structural extension (outpainting) and **(B)** the specific, irregular areas of wall damage (inpainting).\n\nThe system then enters a **parallel processing phase**. The input image, along with a combined mask of both regions, is sent to two different specialized inpainting models simultaneously:\n\n1.  **Structural Branch:** The `Inpainting-MISF-Places2` model, which excels at generating semantically plausible large-scale structures, processes the image. Its primary goal is to create a structurally sound and geometrically correct extension of the restaurant space.\n2.  **Texture Branch:** The `Inpainting-CTSDG-Paris` model, which uses a Transformer architecture ideal for capturing long-range context and textures, also processes the image. Its strength lies in meticulously repairing the damaged wall by understanding and replicating the surrounding texture and lighting.\n\nFinally, the system enters the **synaptic integration phase**. Instead of simply choosing one result, a composition module intelligently merges the outputs. It uses the initial masks to guide the composition: the structurally-sound extensions from the MISF model are used for the outpainted areas, while the texturally-perfect repairs from the CTSDG model are used for the damaged wall areas. This produces a single, coherent final image that leverages the best capabilities of both models.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design Choices**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly tailored to the strengths of the provided models and the nature of the user's request.\n\n1.  **Model Selection & Branching:**\n    *   **Branch 1: `Inpainting-MISF-Places2` for Structure.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The user needs to \"fill in the space structure.\" The MISF paper ([arXiv:2203.06304](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06304)) emphasizes its ability to generate \"semantically plausible\" results for large missing regions. Its two-stage coarse-to-fine network is ideal for first blocking out the high-level structure (tables, room layout) and then refining it. Being trained on the Places2 dataset, which contains a vast number of scenes including restaurant interiors, makes it perfectly suited for this domain.\n        *   **Role:** This model forms the backbone of the new geometry. We trust it to extend the tables and walls in a way that makes architectural sense.\n\n    *   **Branch 2: `Inpainting-CTSDG-Paris` for Texture.**\n        *   **Reasoning:** The user needs to repair \"damaged walls\" and match \"lighting texture.\" The CTSDG paper ([arXiv:2108.09760](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09760)) highlights its Transformer-based architecture, which excels at modeling long-range dependencies. This is critical for repairing a patch on a wall, as the model needs to understand the texture and lighting from distant, undamaged parts of the same wall. Its ability to handle irregular masks (common for damage) and generate \"diverse and plausible\" textures makes it the superior choice for high-fidelity repair.\n        *   **Role:** This model acts as a specialist finisher, ensuring the repaired areas are texturally and luminously indistinguishable from the original surface.\n\n2.  **Superiority of the CNAPS Approach:**\n    *   A simple **linear pipeline** (e.g., running MISF first, then CTSDG on its output) would be suboptimal. The second model would be processing artificially generated pixels, which could compound errors or lead to artifacts."
