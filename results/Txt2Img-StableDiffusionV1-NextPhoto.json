    "llm_b": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance existing menu photos so they resemble high-end DSLR-quality images with natural lighting.  \nSub-goals include:\n- Remove blur and improve sharpness\n- Enhance lighting and simulate natural soft shadows\n- Preserve the food’s natural appearance\n- Achieve overall professional photo quality\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis CNAPS workflow uses a dual-branch strategy:\n\n1. **Clarity Enhancement Path**: The input photo is passed to **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** to eliminate blur and boost fine detail. This branch focuses on achieving DSLR-level sharpness and texture fidelity.\n\n2. **Style Reference Generation Path**: In parallel, a descriptive prompt such as “DSLR-quality food photo under natural light with soft shadows” is sent to **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-Realisian** (or **NextPhoto**) to generate a reference image with the desired lighting aesthetics.\n\nThese two branches do not merge computationally. Instead, the user is given:\n- A deblurred version of their original photo\n- A photorealistic reference image representing the target aesthetic\n\nThis separation is due to the lack of an image-to-image style transfer model in the provided tools.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis dual-branch CNAPS approach acknowledges both technical limitations and visual goals:\n\n- Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur fulfills the DSLR-level **clarity** requirement by resolving noise and blur while preserving food texture\n- Stable Diffusion (Realisian or NextPhoto) supports **style matching** via generative sampling from descriptive prompts\n- Since no image-to-image style transfer model is available, the system outputs both images separately, allowing users to compare their original with a lighting ideal for reference",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow for the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to automatically enhance their existing menu photographs to appear as if they were shot by a professional photographer using a high-end DSLR camera with natural lighting.\n\nThis involves two primary sub-goals:\n*   **Clarity and Detail Enhancement:** The input photos may be blurry or lack sharpness. The workflow must increase the perceived resolution and detail to mimic a DSLR's clarity. This directly relates to **structure preservation** and **texture realism**.\n*   **Aesthetic and Lighting Style Matching:** The workflow must adjust the image's aesthetic to match the \"natural light\" style, which is distinct from harsh, on-camera flash.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the initial input signal branches into two parallel processing paths to handle the distinct sub-goals of clarity and style. The results are then synthesized at a final node.\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single menu photo as its primary input. This input immediately triggers a **synaptic branch**.\n\n*   **Path A (Clarity Path):** The original photo is routed directly to the **Deblur-MIMO-UNet** model. This path's sole function is to remove motion or focus blur and dramatically increase the sharpness and textural detail of the food, fulfilling the \"DSLR-level clarity\" requirement.\n\n*   **Path B (Style Reference Path):** In parallel, a text prompt describing the user's desired aesthetic—\"Professional food photography, natural light, soft shadows, DSLR quality\"—is sent to the **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-Realisian** model. This model does *not* see the user's original photo. Instead, it generates a *new, separate image* that serves as a perfect visual example of the target style. This path's function is to define the \"natural light\" aesthetic.\n\n*   **Synaptic Merge:** The outputs from both paths—the sharp, deblurred photo from Path A and the stylized reference photo from Path B—are brought together at a final decision node. Since the provided tools do not include an image-to-image style transfer model, the system cannot automatically merge the style onto the deblurred image. Instead, the workflow's final output presents both images to the user, providing the enhanced-clarity version of their photo and a clear, AI-generated target for the desired lighting style, along with an explanation of the technical limitation.\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is dictated by the capabilities and limitations of the provided models.\n\n1.  **Choice of `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur` for Clarity (Branch A):**\n    *   **Relevance:** The user's request for \"DSLR-level clarity\" directly translates to a technical need for deblurring and detail enhancement. Amateur photos are often slightly out of focus or suffer from motion blur.\n    *   **Justification:** The **Deblur-MIMO-UNet** model is explicitly designed for \"Single Image Deblurring.\" According to its paper, it uses a multi-input, multi-output architecture with a UNet backbone to progressively restore sharp details from a coarse to a fine level. This makes it the ideal and only choice in the provided list for directly addressing the clarity sub-goal on the user's existing image.\n    *   **Reference:** Cho et al., \"Rethinking Coarse-To-Fine Approach in Single Image Deblurring\" ([https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf))\n\n2.  **Choice of `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-Realisian` for Style (Branch B):**\n    *   **Relevance:** The \"natural light\" requirement is a stylistic one. None of the provided models can perform image-to-image style transfer (e.g., taking the style of one"
