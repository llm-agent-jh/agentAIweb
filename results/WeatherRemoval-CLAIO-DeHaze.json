    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a blurry, fog-degraded photograph of a store to achieve clear, sharp visibility of both the store and its background. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Atmospheric dehazing**: Removing fog/haze that obscures scene visibility\n- **Deblurring**: Restoring sharpness to motion-blurred or focus-degraded elements\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintaining architectural details and text legibility\n- **Texture realism**: Ensuring natural-looking surface details after restoration\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synapse network** where the input image simultaneously flows through specialized restoration pathways. The fog-degraded image branches into two parallel processing streams: one focused on atmospheric clearing and another on motion/blur correction. Each branch operates independently to preserve specialized processing integrity, then their outputs merge through an adaptive fusion mechanism that selectively combines the best restoration features from each pathway. The system includes feedback loops for quality assessment and potential re-processing if initial results don't meet clarity thresholds.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis **synaptic branching architecture** is optimal because fog removal and deblurring require fundamentally different mathematical approaches. The MSSNet paper demonstrates that motion deblurring benefits from multi-scale spatial attention, while atmospheric dehazing requires different spectral and depth-aware processing. By processing these degradations in parallel branches, we preserve each model's specialized capabilities while avoiding interference between different restoration algorithms. The adaptive fusion ensures that the best aspects of each restoration pathway contribute to the final result, creating a more robust and comprehensive image restoration system than any single-model approach could achieve.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **clean up a foggy photo taken in front of a store** so that the **background becomes clear and sharp**.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Fog and haze removal\n- Image deblurring (especially background details)\n- Global contrast and illumination correction\n- Maintaining natural color and structure\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system begins with the blurry, foggy image input. The workflow first routes the image into a fog and haze removal module to suppress atmospheric scattering and enhance visibility.\n\nIn parallel, a deblurring module targets motion or lens blur, especially in background regions. After both processes, the enhanced and deblurred outputs are merged via a region-aware fusion strategy that preserves edge sharpness and avoids overprocessing.\n\nAn optional low-light enhancer further adjusts global brightness and contrast if the defogged image appears underexposed or washed out.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze**  \n  This module is specialized for fog and haze suppression. It reduces light scattering, revealing occluded details in fog-heavy images.\n\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro**  \n  📄 [MSSNet paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)  \n  MSSNet leverages multiscale semantic segmentation to isolate and correct blurry regions, especially in complex scenes with varied motion blur patterns.\n\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**  \n  When fog removal leads to contrast loss or gray tones, this module improves global illumination and contrast, restoring the image’s vividness.\n\nThis CNAPS workflow branches into haze suppression, deblurring, and optional enhancement, then merges outputs via a compositing module. It ensures clarity, natural color, and scene integrity across the final image.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to solve the user's request using only the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a photograph that suffers from two distinct forms of degradation: atmospheric haze (fog) and a general lack of sharpness (blur).\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Fog Removal:** To eliminate the atmospheric scattering effect of fog, which reduces contrast and washes out colors.\n*   **Deblurring / Sharpening:** To increase the definition of edges and restore fine details lost to camera shake, motion, or focus issues.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The underlying geometry of the store and background must remain intact without distortion.\n*   **Artifact Avoidance:** The final image should be free of processing artifacts, such as color banding or unnatural \"glowing\" edges.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis problem is perfectly suited for a CNAPS workflow because the two main degradations (fog and blur) can be addressed by specialized models. A parallel, synaptic approach allows each model to work on the original data to extract the best possible information before fusing the results, which is superior to a simple linear pipeline where errors from the first model can cascade to the second.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins by taking the user's single foggy and blurry image as input. This input is then routed simultaneously into two parallel processing branches, like a signal splitting at a synapse.\n\n*   **Branch A (Atmospheric Correction):** This branch sends the image to the `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` model. Its sole purpose is to remove the fog, restoring natural color and global contrast. The output is an image that is no longer hazy but may still be blurry.\n*   **Branch B (Structural Restoration):** In parallel, the original image is also sent to the `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro` model. This model, an expert in deblurring, focuses on identifying and sharpening edges and textures. Its output will be a structurally sharp image, but it might contain color or contrast artifacts because it had to process the foggy data.\n\nFinally, the two intermediate outputs are sent to a **Fusion Synapse**. This merge-step intelligently combines the clean colors and contrast from Branch A's output with the sharp structural details from Branch B's output. This fusion creates a final image that is both clear of fog *and* sharply detailed, achieving the user's goal.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly chosen over a simple linear pipeline for robustness and quality.\n\n1.  **Model Selection & Role Assignment:**\n    *   **`WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze` (Branch A):** This model is selected for its explicit function of \"DeHaze,\" directly addressing the user's complaint about \"fog.\" It forms the atmospheric correction branch, tasked with restoring the image's color and contrast base.\n    *   **`Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro` (Branch B):** This model is selected to tackle the user's request for a \"clear and sharp\" result, targeting the \"blurry\" nature of the photo. The associated paper ([MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) describes it as a **Multi-Stage and Scale-depth Network**. This multi-scale architecture is crucial because it processes the image at different resolutions, making it highly effective at restoring details without being overly sensitive to the noise and low contrast caused by the fog. This makes it a perfect candidate for the structural restoration branch.\n\n2.  **Rationale for the Synaptic (Parallel) Structure:**\n    *   **Avoiding Error Propagation:** In a linear pipeline (`Dehaze -> Deblur`), any artifacts introduced by the `DeHaze` model (e.g., slight softening of details) would be passed to and potentially amplified by the `Deblur` model. The parallel structure avoids this by allowing both specialist models to work on the pristine, original input data.\n    *   **Synergistic Fusion:** The core of the CNAPS philosophy is synergy. Neither intermediate output (`Output A` or `Output B`) is perfect on its own. `Output A` has good color but is blurry. `Output B` has sharp edges but may have poor color due to processing a foggy image. The **Fusion Synapse** combines the strengths of both. A common technique for this fusion is to:\n        1.  Take the color information (chrominance channels) from the `Dehazed Image"
