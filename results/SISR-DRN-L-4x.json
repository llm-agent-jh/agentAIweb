    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a blurry, small figure photo by enlarging it 4x while restoring fine details** like decorative elements and facial expressions. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Deblurring**: Remove motion blur or focus blur to recover sharp details\n- **Super-resolution**: Upscale the image 4x while preserving and enhancing texture realism and structural details\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **sequential-parallel hybrid network** where the input image first branches into two deblurring pathways (RealBlurR and RealBlurJ variants of MSSNet) that specialize in different blur types. These parallel branches process the image simultaneously, then their outputs are evaluated and the best result is selected or merged. The enhanced image then flows into the Swin2SR super-resolution module for 4x upscaling, which leverages the improved clarity from the deblurring stage to generate high-quality fine details in decorations and expressions.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1 & 2: Parallel Deblurring Branch**\n- **Input**: RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurR**: Optimized for real-world blur patterns with radial characteristics\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurJ**: Optimized for JPEG compression artifacts combined with blur\n- **Output**: Two deblurred candidates (H×W×3)\n\n**Module 3: Selection/Fusion Unit**\n- **Input**: Two deblurred images\n- **Process**: Quality metrics evaluation (PSNR, SSIM, perceptual quality)\n- **Output**: Single best deblurred image (H×W×3)\n\n**Module 4: Super-Resolution Enhancement**\n- **Input**: Deblurred image (H×W×3)\n- **Swin2SR-Classical-4x**: Transformer-based upscaling with attention to fine details\n- **Output**: Final enhanced image (4H×4W×3)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\n**MSSNet Selection**: The dual-branch MSSNet approach is justified because the paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) demonstrates that different blur types require specialized handling. RealBlurR and RealBlurJ variants target different real-world degradation patterns commonly found in figure photography.\n\n**Swin2SR Integration**: The Swin2SR paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345) shows superior performance on classical SR tasks, particularly for preserving fine details and textures essential for figure decoration and expression restoration. The 4x variant directly matches the user's requirement.\n\n**Sequential Architecture**: Deblurring before super-resolution is optimal because upscaling sharp details produces better results than attempting to enhance blurry features, as demonstrated in both referenced papers' comparative analyses.",
    "llm_b": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a small, blurry photograph of a person. The primary goal is to increase its resolution by a factor of four while simultaneously removing blur to recover fine details in the person's clothing (\"decoration\") and face (\"expression\").\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove motion or focus blur from the source image.\n*   **Super-Resolution (4x):** Increase the image dimensions by 400%.\n*   **Detail & Texture Restoration:** Reconstruct high-frequency details like fabric patterns, facial features, and textures that were lost due to blur and low resolution.\n*   **Artifact Suppression:** Ensure the process does not introduce new, distracting artifacts (e.g., checkerboarding, unrealistic textures).\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the initial input is routed down a conditional path based on its properties before the results are merged for final processing.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single, small, blurry image as input.\n\nFirst, it performs a pre-processing analysis to check the image's file format, specifically identifying if it has undergone JPEG compression, which introduces unique artifacts. This analysis acts as a **synaptic trigger**, directing the image down one of two specialized deblurring paths.\n\n*   **Path 1 (JPEG):** If the image is a JPEG, it is routed to the **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** model. This model is specifically trained on the RealBlur-J dataset, which includes images with JPEG compression artifacts, making it the ideal choice for this common scenario.\n*   **Path 2 (Non-JPEG/RAW):** If the image is in a lossless format like PNG or is a very high-quality JPEG with minimal compression, it is routed to the **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** model, which is trained on more general, realistic blur without a specific focus on compression artifacts.\n\nThe two paths then **merge**. The output from whichever deblurring model was used is a clean, sharp, but still small image. This deblurred intermediate result is then passed as the input to the final stage.\n\nFinally, the sharp, low-resolution image is processed by the **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** model. This Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) model enlarges the image by the requested 4x factor, using the clean details from the previous step to generate a high-resolution, detailed final output.\n\nThe final output is a single, 4x larger, and sharp image that restores the figure's details and expression.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and Model Selection**\n\nThe design of this workflow is dictated by the principle of tackling image degradation problems in a logical sequence, using specialized models for each sub-task.\n\n1.  **Overall Strategy (Deblur First, then Upscale):** The sequence of deblurring before super-resolution is critical. Applying super-resolution to a blurry image would amplify the blur, making it harder for a deblurring model to fix. By deblurring the small image first, we provide the super-resolution model (**SISR-Swin2SR**) with a much cleaner and more detailed source to \"imagine\" the high-resolution version from. This leads to a sharper final result with fewer artifacts.\n\n2.  **Conditional Deblurring Branch (The \"Synapse\"):** The core of the CNAPS design lies in the conditional routing to different deblurring models.\n    *   **Justification:** The **MSSNet paper** ([https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) explicitly introduces two datasets: RealBlur-R (captured from RAW) and RealBlur-J (JPEG-compressed versions).\n    *   **Module A (Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ):** This model is chosen for JPEG inputs because it has been specifically trained to handle the combination of motion blur and compression artifacts characteristic of JPEG images. This makes it more robust and effective for the most common type of user-submitted photo.\n    *   **Module B (Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR):** This model is the fallback for higher-quality or lossless inputs. It excels at removing realistic, spatially-varying blur without being biased towards JPEG artifacts.\n    *   This branching logic ensures the best possible tool is used for the specific type of degradation present in the input image, maximizing the quality of the intermediate result.\n\n3.  **Final Super-Resolution Stage:**\n    *   **Module C (SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x):** This model is perfectly suited for the final step.\n    *   **Justification:** The model name itself confirms its purpose: \"SISR\" for Single Image Super-Resolution and \"4x\" for the scaling factor, directly matching the user's request to \"enlarge it 4 times.\" The **Swin2SR paper** ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) describes the Swin Transformer V2 architecture, which is highly effective at capturing long-range dependencies and reconstructing complex textures. This is essential for achieving the user's goal of restoring \"detailed decoration and expression,\" which are composed of high-frequency details that simpler models might fail to render realistically.",
