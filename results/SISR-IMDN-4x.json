    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **upscale a book cover image by 4× magnification** to make the title and visual details clearly readable. The primary goal is **single image super-resolution (SISR)** with sub-goals including:\n- Structure preservation of text elements (title, author, publisher info)\n- Texture realism for cover artwork and background\n- Edge sharpness for readable typography\n- Overall visual quality enhancement\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system implements a **multi-branch super-resolution network** where the input book cover flows through three parallel SISR models, each optimized for different aspects of image enhancement. The **SISR-IMDN-4x** branch focuses on lightweight feature extraction, **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** leverages transformer attention for global context understanding (crucial for text coherence), and **SISR-ESRT-4x** provides additional texture refinement. The three enhanced outputs are then intelligently fused using a weighted combination strategy that prioritizes text clarity and structural integrity, producing a final 4× upscaled image with optimal readability.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture is justified by the complementary strengths of each model:\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** ([arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)) provides efficient multi-scale feature distillation, essential for preserving fine text details without computational overhead.\n\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** ([arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) leverages shifted window attention mechanisms that excel at understanding spatial relationships across the entire image—critical for maintaining text layout coherence and title readability.\n\n- **SISR-ESRT-4x** adds transformer-based texture refinement capabilities, reducing artifacts that could interfere with text clarity.\n\nThe **synaptic fusion approach** ensures that each model's strengths are preserved while weaknesses are compensated through intelligent combination, resulting in superior book cover enhancement specifically optimized for title and text readability.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform a 4× super-resolution on a small book cover image, with two clear sub-goals:\n- **Text Legibility**: Ensure the title is sharp and readable after enlargement.\n- **Image Realism**: Maintain high-fidelity, natural appearance in non-text graphical elements.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system starts by processing the input low-resolution image through a text detection module to generate a binary mask highlighting the text regions. The image and mask are then split into two specialized enhancement paths:\n\n- **Text Enhancement Path**: Routes the image through the `SISR-ESRT-4x` model, selected for its transformer-based capacity to reconstruct fine-grained, structured features like text.\n- **Image Enhancement Path**: Uses `SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x`, which excels at restoring general textures and photographic details in artwork.\n\nAfter both models output 4× upscaled images, the binary text mask is also upscaled to match the output resolution. Finally, a merge module composites a seamless final image by taking pixels from the ESRT branch in text regions and Swin2SR branch elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification\n\n- **ESRT for Text Regions**: Chosen for its transformer architecture, likely good at modeling structured patterns such as fonts, spacing, and stroke consistency.\n- **Swin2SR for General Content**: Backed by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345), it achieves top-tier performance in classical image restoration.\n- **Exclusion of IMDN**: While efficient ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)), IMDN trades off quality for speed, so not ideal for the highest-clarity task.\n- **Merge Phase**: Mask-based compositing ensures clear, sharp text while retaining visually coherent and natural textures across the image.\n\nThis CNAPS workflow delivers a high-resolution result using targeted specialization while maintaining structural and visual integrity.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of a CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a 4x super-resolution on a small book cover image. The primary goal is to make both the text of the title and the graphical elements of the cover art sharp, clear, and legible in the final, enlarged image.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Text Legibility:** The highest priority is restoring the characters of the title so they can be easily read. This requires sharp edges and suppression of artifacts.\n*   **Image Realism:** The non-text parts of the cover (artwork, photos, textures) should be upscaled with high fidelity and realistic detail.\n*   **Structural Cohesion:** The final output must be a single, seamless image that perfectly combines the enhanced text and image components without visible borders or inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a \"divide and conquer\" system. It first analyzes the input to identify different types of content (text vs. general image) and then routes the data to specialized model branches that are best suited for each content type. The results are then intelligently merged for a superior final output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins when the low-resolution book cover image is ingested. A pre-processing module first identifies the regions of the image containing text, creating a binary mask.\n\nThis is the **synaptic branch point**. The system now proceeds down two parallel paths:\n\n1.  **Text Enhancement Branch:** The original image is sent to the **SISR-ESRT-4x** model. Transformer-based architectures like ESRT are exceptionally good at understanding context and reconstructing structured patterns with sharp, high-frequency details, making them ideal for restoring degraded text.\n2.  **Image Enhancement Branch:** The original image is also sent to the **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** model. This powerful model, based on the Swin Transformer, excels at general-purpose, high-fidelity image restoration. It is perfect for restoring the rich textures, colors, and details of the cover's artwork.\n\nAfter both models complete their 4x upscaling, the workflow enters the **merge phase**. The text mask generated earlier is also upscaled to match the new 4x resolution. This mask is then used to composite the final image: pixels from the ESRT result are used for the text regions, while pixels from the Swin2SR result are used for all other regions.\n\nThe final output is a single, coherent 4x image that leverages the specialized strengths of two different models to achieve optimal clarity for both text and graphics.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and Design Rationale**\n\nThis CNAPS design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because the user's request contains two distinct restoration challenges (text and image) that benefit from different model architectures.\n\n1.  **Branching for Specialization:** A single model, while good, must compromise between restoring sharp text and natural textures. By branching the workflow, we can apply the best tool for each specific job.\n    *   **Justification for Branch A (Text):** The **SISR-ESRT-4x** (Efficient Super-Resolution Transformer) model was chosen for text. While its paper is not provided, its name implies a Transformer-based architecture. Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies and contextual relationships, which is critical for reconstructing the consistent strokes, shapes, and spacing of characters in a font. This architectural strength makes it the best candidate for the `Text Legibility` sub-goal.\n    *   **Justification for Branch B (Image):** The **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** model was chosen for the general image content. Its paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) highlights its state-of-the-art performance in classical image super-resolution tasks. Its Swin Transformer architecture is highly effective at restoring complex textures and photographic details, making it the ideal choice for the `Image Realism` sub-goal.\n\n2.  **Model Exclusion:**\n    *   **SISR-IMDN-4x:** According to its paper ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)), IMDN is designed to be a *lightweight* and efficient model. While effective, for a task where maximum quality is the goal, the more powerful (though computationally heavier) Swin2SR is a better choice for the general artwork. Therefore, IMDN is not used in this primary quality-focused workflow.\n\n3.  **Merging for Cohesion:** The `Masked Merge` module is the key to fulfilling the `Structural Cohesion` sub-goal. It ensures that the final image is a seamless composite, taking the best pixels from each specialized branch without creating artifacts or visible joins. This produces a single, high-quality result that holistically addresses all parts of the user's request."
