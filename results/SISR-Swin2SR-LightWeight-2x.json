A third pathway using HAN-8x provides high-detail reference features. These streams process different aspects simultaneously, then merge their outputs through a weighted fusion mechanism that combines the best qualities of each approach—compression artifact removal, precise 2x scaling, and high-frequency detail recovery.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** ([arXiv:2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) is specifically designed for compressed images. It handles blocking and ringing artifacts, offering smooth yet accurate reconstructions ideal for product photography.\n- **SISR-RCAN-it-2x** ([arXiv:2201.11279](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11279)) offers precise 2x upscaling and preserves texture and color due to its residual channel attention mechanism—essential for the user’s goal of visual clarity.\n- **SISR-HAN-8x** ([arXiv:2008.08767](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08767)) contributes rich high-frequency textures via holistic attention and spatial-channel fusion. Its output, though 8x, is rescaled to 2x for integration as reference detail.\n- The **Adaptive Fusion Module** combines the strengths of each model, using local feature confidence maps to select the best pixel-wise contributions (artifact-free structure from Swin2SR, color detail from RCAN-it, texture refinement from HAN).\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture mimics biological perceptual integration by allowing different synaptic pathways to specialize and merge, producing a high-fidelity, compression-free 2x-enhanced product photo.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a 2x super-resolution on a self-taken product photograph that suffers from compression artifacts.\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Resolution Enhancement:** Upscale the image to twice its original height and width (2x).\n*   **Artifact Removal:** Specifically address and mitigate the \"signs of compression\" (e.g., blocking, ringing).\n*   **Fidelity Restoration:** Ensure the resulting texture is realistic and the colors are clear and accurate, as requested.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the input image is processed in parallel by two specialized branches. The outputs are then intelligently fused to produce a final result that leverages the strengths of both paths.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's low-resolution (LR), compressed image as its primary input. This input immediately branches into two parallel processing streams.\n\n*   **Branch A (Artifact Removal Stream):** This branch is dedicated to handling the compression artifacts. The input image is fed into the **SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** model, which is specifically trained to restore images degraded by compression. Since this model outputs a 4x image, a high-quality downscaling module resamples it to the target 2x resolution. The output of this branch is an image with reduced compression artifacts.\n\n*   **Branch B (Guided Enhancement Stream):** This branch focuses on achieving the user's desired aesthetic of \"clear texture and color.\" It uses the **SISR-RCAN-it-2x** model, which accepts a text prompt to guide the upscaling process. A simple text-processing module extracts keywords from the user's request (\"product photo,\" \"clear texture,\" \"vivid color\") to form a guiding prompt. This model directly outputs a 2x image that is semantically aligned with the user's goals.\n\nFinally, the two 2x resolution images from Branch A and Branch B are sent to a **Fusion Module**. This module intelligently merges them, combining the clean, artifact-free base from Branch A with the enhanced texture and color details from Branch B. The final output is a single, high-quality 2x image that addresses all aspects of the user's request.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because the user's request has two distinct and sometimes conflicting requirements: removing technical flaws (compression) and achieving an aesthetic goal (clear texture/color). A branching architecture allows us to use specialized models for each sub-task.\n\n1.  **Branch A: SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x**\n    *   **Justification:** The user explicitly stated the input \"shows signs of compression.\" The **SISR-Swin2SR-Compressed-4x** model (Paper: [arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) is the only provided tool specifically designed for this degradation. Its use is critical for effectively removing blocking and ringing artifacts.\n    *   **Workflow Step:** Although it produces a 4x image, its specialized training on compressed images makes it the best choice for the artifact removal task. The subsequent downscaling to 2x is a necessary step to align its output with the user's target resolution and the output of the parallel branch.\n\n2.  **Branch B: SISR-RCAN-it-2x**\n    *   **Justification:** The user wants specific visual qualities: \"texture and color can be seen clearly.\" The **SISR-RCAN-it-2x** model (Paper: [arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11279](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11279)) is an Image-to-Text model, meaning it can take semantic guidance. This unique capability allows us to directly translate the user's descriptive goals into a text prompt, guiding the model to focus on enhancing texture and color during the 2x upscaling process. This is a perfect example of a synaptic input influencing a module's behavior.\n    *   **Workflow Step:** This model directly addresses the aesthetic part of the request at the correct 2x scale.\n\n3.  **Fusion Module**\n    *   **Justification:** A simple pipeline might run one model after another, but this can cause issues (e.g., the enhancement model might amplify residual artifacts). The CNAPS fusion approach allows us to combine the \"best of both worlds\": the clean, structurally sound image from Branch A is merged with the rich, detailed textures and colors from Branch B. This ensures the final image is both technically clean and aesthetically pleasing, creating a result superior to what either branch could achieve alone.\n\n4.  **Excluded Model: SISR-HAN-8x**\n    *   **Justification:** The **SISR-HAN-8x** model (Paper: [arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08767](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08767)) was not used"
