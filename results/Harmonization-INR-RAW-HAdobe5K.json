    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **harmonize the color temperature and lighting of a composited face to match the beach background**, creating a natural-looking integrated image. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Color temperature adjustment between foreground face and background\n- Lighting tone harmonization to match beach environment\n- Preservation of facial structure and details during color correction\n- Maintaining realistic skin texture while adjusting tones\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-pathway harmonization network** where the input composited image branches into two specialized processing streams. The **RAW pathway** handles fine-grained color temperature adjustments using the Adobe5K-trained model for professional-grade color correction, while the **Resolution pathway** processes the image at 256x256 resolution using the iHarmony4-trained model for semantic-aware harmonization. Both pathways analyze the same input but focus on different aspects - the RAW pathway emphasizes color science and temperature matching, while the Resolution pathway handles spatial harmonization and lighting consistency. The outputs from both pathways are then merged through a **fusion module** that combines the color temperature corrections with spatial harmonization, producing a final image where the face seamlessly integrates with the beach background's lighting conditions.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **complementary strengths** of the available Harmonization-INR models from the referenced paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01681). The **dual-pathway approach** is justified because:\n\n1. **RAW-HAdobe5K model** excels at professional color grading and temperature adjustment, making it ideal for the user's specific color temperature matching needs\n2. **Res256-iHarmony4 model** provides semantic understanding of harmonization at optimal resolution for facial features\n3. **Branching architecture** allows parallel processing of different harmonization aspects rather than sequential processing that could compound errors\n4. **Fusion approach** combines the color science expertise of Adobe5K training with the semantic harmonization capabilities of iHarmony4 training\n\nThe synaptic design ensures that both **technical color correction** and **perceptual harmonization** are addressed simultaneously, producing results that are both technically accurate and visually natural for the beach composite scenario.",

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's image harmonization request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform image harmonization on a composite image. The primary goal is to adjust the color and lighting characteristics (specifically color temperature) of the foreground object (a friend's face) to seamlessly match the ambient lighting of the background (a beach scene).\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n\n*   **Color & Lighting Harmony:** The foreground's color, brightness, and contrast must be adjusted to be consistent with the background.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The facial features and overall structure of the friend's face must remain unchanged and free of distortion.\n*   **Texture Realism:** The skin texture and details of the face must be preserved and look natural in the final image.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first analyzes the input image type and then routes it through parallel processing branches to find the optimal harmonization result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a composite image and a corresponding foreground mask as input. A **Preprocessor & Router** module first inspects the image's color space.\n\nThis creates a primary conditional branch:\n\n1.  **RAW Path (High-Fidelity):** If the input image is in a RAW format, it is sent to a high-fidelity branch. Here, the system leverages the superior color depth of RAW data by processing the image in parallel with two different models trained on RAW datasets: `Harmonization-INR-RAW-HAdobe5K` and `Harmonization-INR-RAW-iHarmony4`. This parallel processing allows the system to generate two high-quality candidates. A **Synaptic Merge Point** then uses a quality scoring metric (or presents them for user selection) to choose the best result.\n\n2.  **sRGB Path (Standard/Fallback):** If the input image is a standard format like JPEG or PNG (i.e., sRGB), it is sent down a separate branch. This path uses the `Harmonization-INR-Res256-iHarmony4` model, which is specifically designed for this common image type.\n\nFinally, the selected harmonized image from the active branch is passed to the output. This branching network ensures that the system uses the most appropriate model for the input data, maximizing quality while maintaining broad compatibility.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is explicitly designed based on the capabilities outlined in the provided paper, \"INR-Harmonization: Image Harmonization in RAW and sRGB Domains using Implicit Neural Representations\" ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01681](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01681)).\n\n1.  **Choice of Harmonization Models:** The user's request is a classic image harmonization task. All three provided models are state-of-the-art solutions for this exact problem, making them the correct tools for the job.\n\n2.  **Conditional Branching (RAW vs. sRGB):** The core of the synaptic design—the branch based on image format—is directly inspired by the paper's primary contribution. The paper introduces models for both the **RAW domain** (`Harmonization-INR-RAW-*`) and the **sRGB domain** (`Harmonization-INR-Res256-*`).\n    *   The **RAW branch** is the premium path. As the paper discusses, processing in the RAW domain leverages higher bit-depth and linear color information, allowing for more precise and physically accurate adjustments to color and lighting. This is ideal for achieving the \"harmonious\" look the user wants.\n    *   The **sRGB branch** serves as a vital, practical alternative. Most users will provide standard JPEGs or PNGs. The `Harmonization-INR-Res256-iHarmony4` model is designed for this scenario, ensuring the system is robust and widely applicable.\n\n3.  **Parallel Processing in the RAW Branch:** The workflow sends the RAW input to both the `HAdobe5K` and `iHarmony4` models simultaneously. This is a key feature of a CNAPS-style system. The models were trained on different datasets (`HAdobe5K` and `iHarmony4`), meaning they may have different strengths. For instance, one might excel at adjusting for harsh sunlight (like a beach scene), while the other might be better with indoor lighting. By running both and selecting the best output, the system increases its chances of producing a superior result, rather than relying on a single model.\n\n4.  **Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for Structure Preservation:** The paper's use of INRs is a critical advantage. INRs represent the image as a continuous function, which allows the models to learn a smooth and complex color transformation. This is crucial for meeting the sub-goal of **structure preservation**. The INR-based adjustment will change the color and tone without distorting the friend's facial features or degrading skin texture, leading to a highly realistic final composite."
