Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Segmentation Branch (MaskFormer-Swin)**\n- **Input**: Video frames (RGB images)\n- **Processing**: Instance segmentation to identify individual people\n- **Output**: Person masks with bounding boxes and confidence scores\n- **Reference**: MaskFormer paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06278)\n\n**Module 2: Pose Estimation Branch (OpenPose)**\n- **Input**: Video frames (RGB images)  \n- **Processing**: 25-point body keypoint detection including arms, shoulders, elbows, wrists\n- **Output**: Keypoint coordinates (x,y) with confidence scores for each detected person\n- **Reference**: OpenPose paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008)\n\n**Module 3: Person-Pose Fusion Module**\n- **Input**: Person masks + keypoint coordinates\n- **Processing**: Correlates segmented persons with their corresponding pose keypoints using spatial overlap\n- **Output**: Matched person-pose pairs with arm-specific keypoint data\n\n**Module 4: Arm Gesture Classifier**\n- **Input**: Arm keypoints (shoulders, elbows, wrists) per person\n- **Processing**: Calculates arm angles and positions relative to body center; applies threshold-based classification for \"arm raised\" state\n- **Output**: Binary arm-raise classification per person per frame\n\n**Module 5: Temporal Tracker & Position Recorder**\n- **Input**: Frame-by-frame gesture classifications + spatial coordinates\n- **Processing**: Tracks individual employees across frames, records gesture timing and spatial positions\n- **Output**: Structured log with employee positions, arm-raise events, timestamps, and durations\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style branching architecture** leverages the strengths of each model:\n\n- **MaskFormer-Swin** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06278) provides robust person segmentation, essential for distinguishing individual employees in group scenarios\n- **OpenPose** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008) delivers precise body keypoint detection, specifically targeting the arm joints needed for gesture recognition\n- The **synapse-like fusion** approach allows both models to process in parallel, then merge their complementary outputs for enhanced accuracy\n\nThe branching design ensures **redundancy and robustness**—if one branch fails (e.g., pose estimation struggles with occlusion), the segmentation branch can still provide person locations. The temporal tracking component addresses the user's need to \"record movements for each position\" by maintaining spatial-temporal continuity across video frames.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to recognize and track instances of employees raising their arms during a training video, assigning each gesture to the correct person and logging the time and position of the action.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Detect and localize each person in every frame\n- Estimate human poses with a focus on arm joints\n- Track each person over time and detect when arms are raised\n- Record position ID, gesture start/end time, and spatial location\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe video is first divided into frames and each frame flows into two parallel branches. The first uses `PoseEstimation-OpenPose` to detect body keypoints per person, including shoulders, elbows, and wrists. The second uses `Segmentation-MaskFormer` to isolate and segment each person in the frame. A synaptic fusion module links pose data to individual segmented masks. From there, an arm-raise detection module classifies whether a person is raising their arm. A temporal tracker then connects frame-by-fra...\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **PoseEstimation-OpenPose** is ideal for multi-person keypoint detection, particularly arm joints needed for gesture classification【263†source】.\n- **Segmentation-MaskFormer** complements pose estimation by providing pixel-accurate masks to improve person tracking and resolve pose ambiguity in group scenes【263†source】.\n- The **Person-Pose Fusion** module matches keypoints to segmented masks to maintain accurate identity tracking across frames.\n- A **temporal tracker** ensures gestures are logged per person across time, satisfying the user’s need for action-by-position tracking.\n\n**Model Not Used:** `ImgTxt2Img-InstructCV` is excluded as it focuses on image editing, not pose or gesture recognition.\n\nThis CNAPS-style multi-pathway architecture mirrors biological processing—dividing the complex task into structural and semantic branches, then merging them to detect and log meaningful human actions from video.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow for your request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform multi-person action recognition on a video. The system must identify every time any employee raises their arm and log these specific events, associating each action with the individual who performed it.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Multi-person Pose Estimation:** Detect the skeletal keypoints (shoulders, elbows, wrists) for every person in each frame.\n*   **Person Identification & Tracking:** Assign a stable identifier to each person (e.g., \"position 1\", \"position 2\") and track them across video frames.\n*   **Temporal Action Detection:** Recognize the \"arm raising\" movement by analyzing the change in pose keypoints over time.\n*   **Structured Data Output:** Record the findings in a structured format that links the person, the action, and the timestamp.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the employee training video frame by frame. For each frame, the workflow branches into two parallel, synaptic paths to extract different types of information simultaneously.\n\n*   **Branch A** uses **PoseEstimation-OpenPose** to detect the skeletal keypoints of all individuals, identifying the raw posture data.\n*   **Branch B** uses **Segmentation-MaskFormer** to generate a precise pixel mask for each individual person, clearly delineating their physical boundaries.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches are then **merged** by a \"Person Associator\" module. This module links each detected pose to its corresponding person mask, creating a rich, unified data object for each person in the frame. This merged data then flows into a temporal module that tracks each person across frames, assigns them a persistent \"position\" ID, and analyzes their pose sequence to detect arm-raising events. Finally, an \"Event Logger\" module compiles these detected events into a structured, time-stamped log file as the final output.\n\nThe model **ImgTxt2Img-InstructCV is not used**, as its purpose is image editing and generation, which is irrelevant to this recognition and analysis task.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification\n\n#### **Branch A: PoseEstimation-OpenPose**\n*   **Purpose:** This is the foundational module for understanding human posture. It directly addresses the need to see \"arm\" movements.\n*   **Justification:** The **OpenPose paper** ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008)) describes a bottom-up approach that excels at real-time, multi-person pose estimation. It first detects all body parts (keypoints) in an image and then associates them with individual people. This is critical for handling scenes with multiple employees simultaneously without needing a separate person detector.\n*   **Intermediate Output (Example):** A JSON structure for the frame.\n    ```json\n    {\n      \"persons\": [\n        { \"person_id\": 0, \"keypoints\": { \"RShoulder\": [210, 150, 0.91], \"RWrist\": [250, 180, 0.88], ... } },\n        { \"person_id\": 1, \"keypoints\": { \"RShoulder\": [450, 155, 0.95], \"RWrist\": [460, 110, 0.92], ... } }\n      ]\n    }\n    ```\n\n#### **Branch B: Segmentation-MaskFormer**\n*   **Purpose:** To robustly identify and isolate each individual employee as a distinct object.\n*   **Justification:** While OpenPose can group keypoints, its association can be fragile in crowded or overlapping scenes. **MaskFormer** ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06278](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.06278)) provides a more powerful method for instance segmentation. It creates a precise pixel-level mask for each person. This mask is an excellent feature for the subsequent tracking step, as its shape and location are more stable frame-to-frame than a simple bounding box. This synaptic branch adds robustness to the overall system.\n*   **Intermediate Output (Example):** A list of binary masks, where each mask is a 2D array corresponding to one person.\n\n#### **Merge Synapse: Person Associator**\n*   **Purpose:** To combine the \"what\" (pose) with the \"who\" (person mask).\n*   **Justification:** This module creates a unified data structure that is essential for the next step. It iterates through each set of pose keypoints from OpenPose and determines which person mask from MaskFormer it falls within. This resolves any ambiguity and ensures that `pose_A` is correctly linked to `person_mask_A`.\n*   **Intermediate Output (Example):** A list of unified objects for the frame.\n    ```json"
