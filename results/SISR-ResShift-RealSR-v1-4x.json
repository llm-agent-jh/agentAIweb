    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\nThe user wants to enhance dark family photos by performing 4x super-resolution to improve the visibility and clarity of facial expressions and clothing textures. This involves two main sub-goals: **low-light enhancement** to brighten dark areas and recover details, and **super-resolution upscaling** to increase image resolution while preserving fine details like facial features and fabric textures.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a synapse-like network where the input dark family photo branches into two parallel enhancement pathways. The **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** processes the image to recover details lost in shadows and improve overall brightness/contrast. Simultaneously, the original image feeds into a **dual super-resolution branch** where both **SISR-IMDN-4x** and **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** perform 4x upscaling with different architectural strengths. The enhanced low-light image then merges with both super-resolution outputs through an **adaptive fusion module** that intelligently combines the brightness-corrected details with the high-resolution structural information, producing a final 4x enlarged image with clear facial expressions and textile details.\n\n### B.

Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n- **Input**: RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **Output**: Brightness-enhanced RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **Function**: Recovers shadow details, improves contrast for facial features\n\n**Module 2: SISR-IMDN-4x** \n- **Input**: Original RGB image (H×W×3)\n- **Output**: Super-resolved image (4H×4W×3)\n- **Function**: Efficient 4x upscaling with information distillation\n- **Reference**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1\n\n**Module 3: SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x**\n- **Input**: Original RGB image (H×W×3) \n- **Output**: Super-resolved image (4H×4W×3)\n- **Function**: Transformer-based 4x upscaling with shifted window attention\n- **Reference**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345\n\n**Module 4: Adaptive Fusion**\n- **Input**: Enhanced low-light image (H×W×3) + Two SR outputs (4H×4W×3 each)\n- **Output**: Final enhanced image (4H×4W×3)\n- **Function**: Combines brightness correction with high-resolution details\n\n### D. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the complementary strengths of each model:\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** provides efficient super-resolution through information distillation, excellent for preserving fine clothing textures\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** uses Swin Transformer architecture with shifted window attention, superior for maintaining facial structure and expressions during upscaling\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** specifically addresses the dark house lighting conditions\n- The **synaptic branching** allows parallel processing while the **adaptive fusion** intelligently combines enhanced brightness with high-resolution structural details\n\nThis architecture ensures both the lighting issues and resolution requirements are addressed simultaneously, rather than sequentially, maximizing detail preservation for facial expressions and clothing textures.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enlarge dark indoor family photos by 4x while clearly revealing facial expressions and clothing textures. This includes:\n- **Low-light enhancement** to correct exposure, contrast, and color\n- **4x super-resolution** to restore structural and textural clarity\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe photo is split into two parallel branches. The first branch applies low-light enhancement using `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`, brightening the image and recovering visibility of shadows. The second branch sends the original image to two 4x super-resolution models: `SISR-IMDN-4x` and `SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x`, which independently upscale the image with different strengths (efficiency vs. fidelity). These outputs are fused in an **adaptive module** that selects structural sharpness from Swin2SR, fine texture from IMDN, and applies enhanced lighting from the low-light branch—producing a final bright and sharp 4x upscaled photo.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** recovers dynamic range and clarity in dark regions, ideal for indoor family images【551†source】.\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** is efficient at fine texture recovery (fabric, hair), thanks to its multi-distillation architecture [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)【551†source】.\n- **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x** provides high-fidelity structural restoration using Swin Transformers, essential for natural facial features [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)【551†source】.\n- The **adaptive fusion module** reflects CNAPS' synaptic principle—parallel branches contribute domain-specific strengths, which are then merged for maximum realism and perceptual quality.\n\nThis system ensures that both lighting and resolution issues are handled concurrently and independently, maximizing clarity without overfitting.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, leveraging the specific strengths of the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a 4x super-resolution on family photos that suffer from poor, low-light conditions. The primary goal is to enhance the visual quality so that fine details, specifically facial expressions and clothing textures, become clear and recognizable.\n\nThis involves two main sub-goals:\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** Correcting for underexposure, high noise, and poor color fidelity typical of photos taken in a dark environment.\n*   **High-Fidelity Super-Resolution:** Increasing the image resolution by a factor of four while accurately reconstructing and generating realistic high-frequency details (textures, edges).\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis problem requires a non-linear approach because the tasks of low-light enhancement and super-resolution can interfere with each other. Enhancing first can introduce artifacts that get amplified by super-resolution. Upscaling first can make it harder for the enhancement model to analyze the original lighting and noise patterns. A synaptic, branching workflow allows us to isolate these tasks and fuse their results for a superior outcome.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system operates on a parallel-branching principle. When the original low-light, low-resolution (LR) image is input, it is simultaneously routed down two distinct neural pathways.\n\n1.  **The Detail & Structure Path:** This branch sends the *original* dark image directly to the most powerful super-resolution model, **SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x**. Its purpose is to perform a high-fidelity 4x upscaling focused solely on reconstructing structural details and textures from the source pixels, ignoring the lighting problem for now. This results in a dark but highly detailed high-resolution (HR) image.\n\n2.  **The Lighting & Color Path:** This branch sends the original image to the specialized **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** model. Its sole purpose is to correct the brightness, contrast, and color balance. This results in a well-lit but still low-resolution (LR) image.\n\nFinally, at the **Synaptic Merge** point, the outputs of these two branches are fused. We intelligently combine the structural and texture detail from the first path with the corrected lighting and color information from the second path. This produces a final image that is both bright and sharp, achieving all of the user's goals.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification**\n\n**Input:**\n*   **Format:** A low-resolution image (e.g., JPEG, PNG) taken in low-light conditions.\n*   **Example:** A 600x800 pixel photo of a family where faces are shadowed and colors are muted.\n\n---\n\n**MODULE 1: SISR-Swin2SR-Classical-4x**\n*   **Role:** High-fidelity 4x super-resolution for detail reconstruction.\n*   **Justification:** The user's primary goal is clearer \"facial expressions and clothing textures.\" The **Swin2SR** model (Paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.11345)) is the ideal choice for this path. Its Swin Transformer architecture excels at capturing long-range pixel dependencies, which is critical for realistically reconstructing complex patterns like fabric weaves, hair, and the subtle contours of a face. By feeding it the original, unaltered image, we allow it to work on the purest available data to reconstruct structure without being confused by artifacts from a prior enhancement step. The \"Classical\" variant is trained for standard degradations and will focus purely on the upscaling task.\n*   **Intermediate Output 1 (from Branch 1):**\n    *   **Format:** A 4x high-resolution image (e.g., 2400x3200 pixels).\n    *   **Content:** This image contains sharply reconstructed details and textures but retains the original's poor lighting, appearing dark and with muted colors.\n\n---\n\n**MODULE 2: Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**\n*   **Role:** Illumination and color correction.\n*   **Justification:** This module directly and expertly addresses the \"taken in a dark house\" problem. As a specialized low-light enhancer, its function is to analyze the underexposed image and algorithmically adjust the luminance and chrominance to produce a natural, well-lit result. It effectively \"recovers\" the color and light information that was poorly captured by the camera. Using this in a separate branch prevents it from compromising the detail reconstruction process.\n*   **Intermediate Output 2 (from Branch 2):**\n    *   **Format:** A low-resolution image (e.g., 600x800 pixels).\n    *   **Content:** This image has corrected brightness, contrast, and vibrant colors, but it is still at the original low resolution and lacks fine detail.\n\n---\n\n**SYNAPTIC MERGE & FUSION**\n*   **Role:** To combine"
