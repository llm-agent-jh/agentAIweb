    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\nThe user wants to convert an audio interview recording into text format through speech-to-text transcription. The primary goal is audio-to-text conversion with potential sub-goals including:\n- Audio preprocessing and noise reduction\n- Accurate speech recognition across multiple speakers\n- Proper formatting and structure preservation of the interview content\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system receives an audio interview file and processes it through a branching network where the audio first undergoes preprocessing, then branches into multiple speech recognition pathways for robustness. The transcribed text outputs are then merged and refined through a text processing module that handles formatting, speaker identification, and content structuring. The final output is a clean, structured text transcript of the interview.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Breakdown\n\n**Module 1: Audio Preprocessing**\n- Input: Raw audio file (.mp3, .wav, .m4a)\n- Processing: Audio normalization, noise reduction, speaker separation\n- Output: Cleaned audio segments ready for transcription\n\n**Module 2: Speech-to-Text Processing**\n- Input: Preprocessed audio segments\n- Processing: Automatic speech recognition using available ASR models\n- Output: Raw text transcript with timestamps\n\n**Module 3: Text Refinement & Formatting**\n- Input: Raw transcript text\n- Processing: Uses **Txt2Txt-HuggingFace-facebook-bart-large-cnn** for text summarization and refinement\n- Output: Structured interview transcript with proper formatting\n\n**Reference:** The BART model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461) provides strong text-to-text generation capabilities that can be leveraged for cleaning up and structuring the raw speech recognition output.\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis workflow design addresses the core speech-to-text conversion need while leveraging the available text processing capabilities. The **facebook-bart-large-cnn** model from the provided resources can be utilized in the final stage to refine and structure the raw transcript output, ensuring better readability and organization of the interview content.\n\n**Note:** The provided models are primarily text-to-voice rather than voice-to-text. In a complete implementation, dedicated speech recognition models would be needed for the core transcription task, while the BART model serves the important role of post-processing and refinement.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **convert an interview recording (audio file) into written text**.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- High transcription accuracy\n- Sentence boundary clarity and grammar refinement\n- Optional speaker identification or summarization\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system starts by ingesting the user's interview audio file. A preprocessing unit first analyzes the audio to normalize and prepare it for recognition. Since no ASR (automatic speech recognition) model is directly listed, we assume the use of an external ASR black-box module as an input to the CNAPS workflow.\n\nFrom here, the recognized raw text branches into two paths:\n\n- One branch routes the raw transcript to a text-polishing module, **facebook-bart-large-cnn**, to clean, summarize, and structure the transcription.\n- The second optional path performs speaker-aware tagging or segmentation, if needed, before final output.\n\nThese branches merge into a final text output that is human-readable and optionally optimized for clarity or summary, ready to be saved, reviewed, or shared.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **ASR Component**:  \n  Although no specific ASR is listed, this is a required first step for converting audio to text. The CNAPS design assumes the use of an external pretrained ASR model (e.g., Whisper, Conformer-based ASR, or equivalent).\n\n- **Text Refinement**:  \n  - **facebook-bart-large-cnn**  \n    This model is suitable for summarization and refinement. It helps correct fragmented sentences or overly literal transcriptions by producing cleaner, more readable results.  \n    📄 BART paper: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.13461)\n\n- **Optional Use of Voice Synthesis Models**:  \n  Although **suno-bark** and **fastspeech2_conformer_with_hifigan** are voice generation models (text-to-speech), they are not directly relevant here. However, in a reverse or feedback path (e.g., producing synthetic voice-overs from transcripts), these could be integrated as output modules in a bi-directional CNAPS system.\n\nThis workflow is modular, extensible, and aligns with CNAPS principles—branching for task specialization (text cleaning vs. speaker tracking), merging for cohesive results, and supporting optional outputs based on user context.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow based on the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to convert an audio file of an interview into a text format. This is fundamentally a **Speech-to-Text (ASR)** task.\n\nAn important implied sub-goal, especially for a lengthy interview, is to extract the most important information, which suggests a need for **summarization**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\n**Critical Prerequisite:** The user's primary request is for Audio-to-Text conversion. However, the provided list of models **does not include an Audio-to-Text (ASR) model**. The available models are for Text-to-Text and Text-to-Voice tasks.\n\nTherefore, to create a useful workflow that addresses the user's intent, we must assume a standard ASR module performs the initial conversion. The CNAPS workflow below then processes the resulting text to add significant value using the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system is designed to process an interview recording by first converting it to text and then creating valuable derivatives from that text.\n\nThe workflow begins when the user uploads an interview audio file. A prerequisite ASR module transcribes the audio into a raw text document. This raw transcript is the central node from which the workflow branches.\n\n*   **Path 1 (Direct Output):** The raw transcript is immediately available as a final output, satisfying the user's primary request.\n*   **Path 2 (Summarization Branch):** In parallel, the raw transcript is fed into the **BART model** for abstractive summarization. This creates a new, much shorter text document containing only the key points of the interview. This summary text is also provided as a final output.\n*   **Path 3 (Audio Digest Branch):** The generated text summary then branches off to the **Bark model**, which synthesizes a high-quality audio version of the summary. This creates a final \"audio digest\" of the interview.\n\nThe user ultimately receives a bundle of three outputs: the full text transcript, a concise written summary, and a narrated audio summary.\n\n---\n\n### **B.

    "gpt-4o": "This solution stands out for its comprehensive approach, addressing the lack of an ASR model by proposing an external ASR module, which aligns with practical implementation needs. The workflow is well-organized with clear branching for text processing and optional speaker identification. The use of BART for text refinement is justified, making it the most complete and practical solution within the given constraints.",
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": "Excellent response that directly addresses the core limitation (no ASR model provided) while creating a sophisticated multi-branch workflow. Demonstrates true CNAPS design with parallel processing paths, clear branching and merging logic, and creative use of available models. The three-output system (full transcript, summary, audio digest) shows innovative thinking. Most importantly, provides the most honest and complete reasoning about model limitations while still delivering a practical solution.",
    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This response is the winner due to its superior and more creative workflow design. Like llm_b, it correctly and clearly identifies the prerequisite for an ASR model. However, its \"fan-out\" branching design is more innovative. It not only uses the BART model for summarization but also finds a perfectly logical and value-adding role for the Text-to-Voice model (`suno-bark`) by creating an \"audio digest\" of the summary. This demonstrates a deeper synthesis of the available tools and provides the most comprehensive and useful set of outputs for the user."
