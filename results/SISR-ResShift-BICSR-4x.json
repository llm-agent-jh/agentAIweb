Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **correct light bleed issues in interior house photographs while simultaneously increasing image resolution**, ensuring that structural elements and furniture details remain well-preserved throughout the enhancement process.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Light bleed correction/low-light enhancement\n- Resolution upscaling/super-resolution\n- Structure preservation (walls, architectural elements)\n- Furniture detail retention\n- Overall image quality improvement\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synaptic network** where the input image flows through two specialized processing pathways that work in parallel before merging. The **Enhancement Branch** focuses on correcting light bleed and improving illumination using the low-light enhancer, while the **Deblur Branch** handles any motion blur or focus issues that often accompany light bleed problems using MSSNet models. Both branches process the image simultaneously, then their outputs are intelligently merged to create a final enhanced result that addresses both lighting issues and resolution while preserving structural and furniture details.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Enhancement Branch:**\n- **Input:** Original light-bleed image (RGB, any resolution)\n- **Processing:** Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer corrects exposure, reduces light bleed artifacts, improves overall illumination\n- **Output:** Enhanced image with corrected lighting (RGB, improved dynamic range)\n\n**Deblur Branch:**\n- **Input:** Same original image routed in parallel\n- **Processing:** \n  - MSSNet-RealBlurR handles realistic blur patterns common in interior photography\n  - MSSNet-RealBlurJ processes JPEG compression artifacts that may accompany light bleed\n- **Output:** Deblurred image with enhanced sharpness and detail preservation\n\n**Feature Merging:**\n- **Process:** Intelligent combination of enhanced lighting from Branch 1 and deblurred details from Branch 2\n- **Method:** Weighted blending that preserves the best lighting corrections while maintaining sharp structural and furniture details\n\n**Structure Preservation Check:**\n- **Function:** Validates that architectural elements and furniture details remain intact\n- **Output:** Final enhanced image with corrected light bleed, increased effective resolution, and preserved structural integrity\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** specifically for the primary concern of light bleed correction, while the **MSSNet models** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) address the secondary but related issues of blur and detail loss that often accompany problematic interior lighting conditions. The parallel processing approach ensures that both lighting and sharpness issues are addressed simultaneously without one process negatively impacting the other, ultimately achieving the user's goal of resolution improvement while preserving crucial structural and furniture details.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to correct light bleed issues in interior house photos while enhancing resolution and preserving structural elements and furniture detail.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Remove or correct overexposed regions (light bleed)\n- Preserve geometry of walls, windows, and furniture\n- Improve clarity through targeted blur correction\n- Increase effective image resolution with minimal distortion\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input photo is routed through a dual-branch CNAPS-style network. The first branch uses `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` to restore exposure balance and suppress light bleed. The second branch corrects blur introduced by overexposure using `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` and `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`. Both branches process the image in parallel and are merged via a weighted fusion module.

Justification\n\n- **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** is used to correct the lighting imbalance caused by light bleed, brightening underexposed regions while reducing glare without flattening important features【539†source】.\n- **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** and **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** complement this by recovering structure and edge detail in overexposed zones, especially where compression or real-world motion blur has degraded clarity【539†source】.\n- This **synaptic architecture** reflects the biological principle of modular perception—lighting and structure are handled independently by specialized models, and later merged to form a complete perceptual reconstruction.",
    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to repair overexposed areas (\"light bleed\") in interior photographs and simultaneously increase the image resolution.\n\nThe primary sub-goals are:\n*   **Artifact Removal:** Correct the blown-out highlights and color bleeding, typically originating from windows or bright lights.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the geometric integrity of architectural elements like walls, windows, and doorways.\n*   **Detail Preservation:** Ensure that the textures and fine details of furniture, fabrics, and surfaces are not lost or distorted during the process.\n*   **Resolution Enhancement:** Increase the pixel dimensions of the final image.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that first analyzes the image content to isolate the problem, repairs the isolated area without affecting the rest of the image, and then enhances the entire corrected image.\n\nThe process begins with the low-resolution input image branching into two parallel paths.\n\n1.  **The Analysis Path:** The image is fed into the **OneFormer** segmentation model. This module acts like the brain's visual cortex, identifying and labeling every object in the scene (e.g., \"window,\" \"wall,\" \"chair\"). We specifically extract the \"window\" mask, as this is the most common source of light bleed. This mask defines the precise area that needs repair.\n\n2.  **The Repair Path:** The original image and the generated \"window\" mask are merged as inputs to the **LaMa (Places)** inpainting model. LaMa uses this mask to \"heal\" only the designated light bleed area, filling it with contextually-aware, realistic textures appropriate for an interior scene. The rest of the image remains untouched, perfectly preserving all original furniture and structural details.\n\n3.  **The Enhancement Path:** The now-repaired, low-resolution image is passed to the final module, **Real-ESRGAN**. This model upscales the image by 4x, intelligently adding realistic detail and texture to produce a high-resolution final output that is both clean and sharp.\n\nThis branching approach ensures that the repair is targeted and precise, preventing the degradation of high-quality areas that a global filter might cause.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Justification\n\nThis design is a direct application of the provided tools to solve the user's specific, multi-faceted problem.\n\n*   **MODULE 1: `Segmentation-oneformer-coco`**\n    *   **Role:** Content-aware mask generation.\n    *   **Justification:** The core of this advanced workflow is isolating the problem area. A simple thresholding filter for brightness would be crude and inaccurate. **OneFormer** is a universal segmentation architecture capable of panoptic segmentation—identifying both \"things\" (furniture) and \"stuff\" (walls). This allows us to create a highly precise mask for the \"window\" class, which is the source of the light bleed. This directly addresses the user's need to \"preserve structure and furniture details\" by ensuring they are not part of the subsequent repair step.\n    *   **Reference:** The [OneFormer Paper (arXiv:2211.06220)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06220) highlights its state-of-the-art ability to unify semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, making it the ideal tool for this analytical task.\n\n*   **MODULE 2: `Inpainting-lama-places`**\n    *   **Role:** Targeted artifact removal.\n    *   **Justification:** \"Light bleed\" is effectively a large, corrupted region. The **LaMa** model is specifically designed for high-resolution inpainting on large, irregular masks. Its use of Fast Fourier Convolutions (FFCs) gives it a large receptive field, allowing it to understand the global scene structure and generate plausible, non-repetitive textures to fill the window area. The `places` variant is critically important here, as it was trained on the Places2 dataset, which is rich with architectural and interior scenes. This domain-specific training ensures the inpainted result is contextually correct.\n    *   **Reference:** The [LaMa Paper (arXiv:2109.07161)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07161) validates this choice, emphasizing its effectiveness for \"challenging scenarios (e.g., completion of periodic structures).\" This is perfect for replacing a blown-out window with a realistic one that matches the surrounding room.\n\n*   **MODULE 3: `Upscaling-esrgan-x4-RealESRGAN`**\n    *   **Role:** High-fidelity resolution enhancement.\n    *   **Justification:** After the image content is repaired, the final step is to increase the resolution. While standard ESRGAN is good, **Real-ESRGAN** is superior for real-world images that have complex, unknown degradations—exactly our use case. It is trained with a more comprehensive degradation process, making it robust and capable of generating finer, more realistic details than its predecessor. This directly fulfills the user's request to \"increase the resolution\" while \"preserving details.\"\n    *   **Reference:** The [Real-ESRGAN Paper (arXiv:2107.10833)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833) explains that it \"produces better visual results on real-world images\" by modeling more complex artifacts, which makes it the definitive choice for this final enhancement step.\n\n### Excluded Models\n\n*   **`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`**: This model is for correcting underexposure (too dark), whereas \"light bleed\" is an overexposure problem (too bright). It is functionally the opposite of what is needed.\n*   **`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR/J`**: The user did not report any motion or focus blur, so a deblurring model is unnecessary and could potentially introduce new artifacts.\n*   **`Inpainting"
