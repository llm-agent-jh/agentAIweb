The apologetic tone suggests the photos may have quality issues like blur or lack of sharpness.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- 2x resolution upscaling\n- Blur reduction/deblurring\n- Detail enhancement and sharpening\n- Structure preservation of landscape elements\n- Texture realism maintenance\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where input landscape photos flow through multiple specialized processing paths that eventually merge for optimal results. The workflow branches into two parallel enhancement streams: one focused on **deblurring** and another on **structure preservation/inpainting**. These streams process different aspects of image quality simultaneously, then merge their outputs through a fusion mechanism that combines the best features from each path before final upscaling.\n\nThe branching occurs early to allow specialized processing, while the merging happens strategically to leverage the strengths of each module. A quality assessment gate determines if additional processing iterations are needed.\n\n### B.

High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow starts by feeding the user’s blurry, low-resolution image into two different deblurring models: **Deblur-MIMO-UNet** and **Deblur-MSSNet**, each producing their own deblurred version.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, leveraging the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform real-world image restoration on their landscape photos. The primary goal is to increase the resolution by a factor of two while simultaneously improving the visual quality by removing blur and enhancing details.\n\nThe sub-goals involved are:\n*   **Upscaling:** Enlarge the image dimensions by 2x.\n*   **Deblurring:** Remove artifacts like motion blur or out-of-focus softness to make the image \"clearer.\"\n*   **Detail & Texture Realism:** Generate plausible high-frequency details during upscaling, ensuring the final image looks natural and not artificial.\n*   **Robustness:** The workflow must handle complex, real-world degradations, not just simple, synthetic ones.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network, featuring a parallel processing branch for deblurring and a conditional selection node to ensure the highest quality intermediate result is passed to the final super-resolution stage.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins when the user's low-quality landscape photo is ingested. Instead of a single linear path, the system immediately branches at a \"Deblurring Synapse.\" The input image is sent in parallel to two distinct deblurring models: **Deblur-MIMO-UNet** and **Deblur-MSSNet**. These models work independently to produce two deblurred versions of the original image.\n\nThese two candidate images then converge at a \"Quality Evaluator\" node. This module programmatically assesses both outputs for sharpness and the absence of artifacts. It then makes a conditional choice, selecting only the superior result.\n\nThis single, best-quality deblurred image is then passed to the final module, **Super-Resolution-BSRGAN-x2**, which performs the 2x upscaling. This model is specifically designed to handle real-world images and generates realistic textures, fulfilling the user's request for more detail. The final output is a single high-resolution, clear, and detailed landscape photo.\n\n---\n\n#### **B. Visual Flow Diagram (block-style, text-based)**\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Input: Low-Quality Landscape Photo] --> B{Parallel Deblurring Synapse};\n\n    subgraph \"Branching Path\"\n        B --> C[Module A: Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur];\n        B --> D[Module B: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR];\n    end\n\n    C --> E[Output A: Deblurred Image];\n    D --> F[Output B: Deblurred Image];\n\n    subgraph \"Merging & Conditional Path\"\n        E --> G{Merging/Selection Node: Quality Evaluator};\n        F --> G;\n    end\n\n    G -- Selects best result based on sharpness & artifact score --> H[Intermediate: Selected Deblurred Image];\n    H --> I[Module C: Super-Resolution-BSRGAN-x2];\n    I --> J[Final Output: 2x Enlarged, Clear Landscape Photo];\n\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture is deliberately chosen over a simple pipeline to maximize quality and robustness.\n\n1.  **Parallel Deblurring Synapse (Modules A & B):** The user's photos are \"not good,\" which implies they suffer from real-world, non-uniform blur.\n    *   **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** ([Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)) uses a multi-input, multi-output U-Net that processes the image at different scales simultaneously. This is excellent for handling blurs of varying sizes within the same image.\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** ([Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) employs a Multi-Stage Splitting Network, which breaks down the complex deblurring task into more manageable stages.\n    *   **Justification:** Since these models use different architectural philosophies, one may outperform the other depending on the specific nature of the blur in a given photo. By running both in parallel, the system avoids committing to a single, potentially sub-optimal approach. This branching is the core of the CNAPS design, creating an ensemble that increases the likelihood of a high-quality result.\n\n2.  **Merging/Selection Node (Quality Evaluator):** This is the critical conditional step. A simple system might average the two deblurred results, but this often leads to a soft image with blended artifacts.\n    *   **Justification:** A smarter approach is to evaluate and select the best one. This node would use no-reference image quality metrics (e.g., measuring sharpness with Laplacian variance, or a perceptual-based metric like NIQE/BRISQUE) to score `Output A` and `Output B`. The path is then conditionally routed, passing only the highest-scoring image forward. This ensures that downstream processing is performed on the best possible input.\n\n3.  **Final Restoration Stage (Module C):** The final step addresses the user's explicit \"enlarge them twice\" and \"more details\" request.\n    *   **Super-Resolution-BSRGAN-x2** ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03072)) is the ideal choice. The \"x2\" matches the user's request perfectly. More importantly, it is a **Blind** Super-Resolution model. The paper highlights its ability to handle complex, unknown degradations, which is exactly the situation with user-provided photos. The GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture excels at hallucinating realistic textures and fine details, directly fulfilling the need for \"more details.\"\n\n4.  **Architectural Order (Deblur then Super-Resolve):** The workflow performs deblurring *before* super-resolution. This is a deliberate and crucial design choice. Attempting to deblur an already upscaled image is computationally expensive and less effective, as the upscaling process would have already amplified the blur and introduced its own artifacts. By restoring the image at its original resolution first, we provide a clean, high-quality input to the super-resolution model, leading to a far superior final result.\n\n5.  **Omitted Model (Inpainting-MISF-Places2):** The **Inpainting-MISF-Places2** model ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.06304)) was not used because the user's request does"
