    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **restore a blurry profile picture to clarity while reducing puffiness around the eyes and maintaining natural facial structure and pose**. This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Image deblurring** to restore sharpness and detail\n- **Facial structure preservation** to maintain natural appearance without distortion\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the blurry profile picture through a **synapse-like branching network** where the input image flows to multiple specialized deblurring modules operating in parallel. Each MSSNet variant (RealBlurR, RealBlurJ, and L-GoPro) processes the image simultaneously, leveraging their different training specializations. The outputs then merge through a **confidence-weighted fusion mechanism** that selects the best restored regions from each model based on local image quality metrics, particularly focusing on facial features like eyes. This branching-merging approach ensures optimal restoration while preserving natural facial structure.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Multi-Scale Separable Network (MSSNet)** architecture's strength in handling diverse blur types through parallel processing. According to the MSSNet paper, different training datasets (RealBlurR, RealBlurJ, GoPro) capture distinct blur characteristics, making parallel deployment advantageous for unknown blur types in user photos.\n\nThe **synaptic branching approach** ensures that:\n1. **Robustness**: Multiple models handle different blur patterns simultaneously\n2. **Quality**: Confidence-weighted fusion selects optimal regions from each output\n3. **Facial preservation**: Eye region prioritization maintains natural structure as requested\n\n**Reference**: MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) demonstrates superior performance through multi-scale processing and separable convolutions, justifying the parallel deployment strategy for optimal profile picture restoration.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a slightly blurry profile picture by enhancing clarity and sharpness while preserving the natural facial structure and pose. Although puffiness around the eyes is noted, the main goal is visual restoration, not semantic modification.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Remove blur while preserving facial identity\n- Restore clarity in eye and facial regions\n- Maintain original lighting and pose\n- Avoid structural distortion or over-smoothing\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is processed through three parallel deblurring branches, each utilizing a variant of the MSSNet model trained on different datasets (RealBlurR, RealBlurJ, L-GoPro). Each branch independently reconstructs a candidate deblurred version. These candidates are assessed and merged using a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism that prioritizes clarity in critical facial areas such as the eyes. The final output is selected based on local quality metrics to ensure both global sharpness and local facia...\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture leverages three deblurring pathways in parallel, each trained on different degradation types, allowing the system to robustly respond to unknown or mixed blur sources.\n\n- **Why parallel branches?** The MSSNet variants target different blur domains: RealBlurR for real-world scenes, RealBlurJ for compression-degraded images, and L-GoPro for motion-blurred sequences. Using them in tandem ensures broad coverage for profile restoration【154†source】.\n\n- **Why confidence-weighted fusion?** It enables dynamic adaptation: regions with stronger responses (e.g., clearer eyes) are prioritized from the corresponding branch, improving perceived sharpness without over-processing.\n\n- **Why no eye editing?** While the user requested reducing eye puffiness, semantic feature editing (e.g., shape change) requires a face retouching or generative model, which is outside the scope of the provided tools. This design adheres strictly to deblurring-based structural restoration.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the optimal CNAPS-style workflow for this task, using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a low-quality profile picture by removing blur and improving its overall clarity.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Primary Goal:** Deblurring the image to make it sharp.\n*   **Key Constraint:** Preservation of the subject's natural facial structure, identity, and pose.\n*   **Secondary Goal (Out of Scope):** Reducing the appearance of puffy eyes. This is a semantic facial edit, which the provided models are not designed for.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system will process the user's blurry image through a parallel, synaptic-style workflow to maximize the quality of the deblurring result.\n\nThe input image simultaneously enters two specialized deblurring branches, each powered by an MSSNet model trained on a different real-world blur dataset (`RealBlurR` and `RealBlurJ`). Since the exact nature of the blur in the user's photo is unknown, running both models in parallel increases the chance of finding an optimal restoration.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches—two distinct, deblurred candidate images—are then passed to a \"Quality Assessment\" synapse. This module programmatically evaluates both candidates based on sharpness and lack of artifacts. It then selects the superior version as the final output. This branching and selection process avoids being locked into a single model that may not be ideal for this specific image's degradation type. The `GoPro` model is excluded as it is specialized for motion blur, which is less likely to be the sole issue in a blurry profile picture compared to the general-purpose `RealBlur` models.\n\nThe request to reduce \"puffy eyes\" will not be addressed, as it requires semantic facial manipulation, a capability not present in the provided deblurring models.\n\n### B.

The request to alter the appearance of the eyes could not be performed, as it falls outside the capabilities of the available restoration models and would risk altering the natural facial structure.\n        \"];\n    end\n```\n\n### C. Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS-style workflow is specifically designed to leverage the strengths of the provided models while respecting their limitations.\n\n1.  **Parallel Branching with `RealBlurR` and `RealBlurJ`:** The user's image is described as \"blurry,\" a generic term that can encompass motion blur, focus blur, or compression artifacts. The MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) was benchmarked on the **RealBlur** datasets, which are explicitly designed to capture these varied, real-world degradations. By processing the image with both **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** and **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** simultaneously, the system hedges against the uncertainty of the blur type. Each model has been trained on a different subset of real images, giving each a slightly different specialization. This parallel approach is superior to a linear pipeline as it increases the probability of producing a high-quality restoration.\n\n2.  **Exclusion of `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro`:** The GoPro dataset consists of blur generated from averaging frames of high-speed video, making it excellent for correcting clean, predictable motion blur. However, a profile picture is more likely to suffer from a mix of focus, camera shake, and digital artifacts. The `RealBlur` models are therefore more appropriate and broadly applicable to the user's problem. Including the `GoPro` model would add computational cost for a likely inferior result.\n\n3.  **Preservation of Facial Structure:** The user's primary constraint is maintaining the \"natural facial structure and pose.\" The MSSNet models are ideal for this. They are *restorative*, not *generative*. Their goal is to mathematically reverse the blur degradation to recover the original latent sharp image. They do not invent new facial features or alter existing ones, thus perfectly aligning with this critical requirement.\n\n4.  **Addressing the \"Puffy Eyes\" Limitation:** The workflow explicitly acknowledges that this request cannot be fulfilled. The provided models are deblurring networks. A task like reducing puffiness requires a semantic understanding of facial parts and is the domain of different architectures, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or diffusion models trained specifically for facial editing. By identifying this limitation, the system provides an honest and accurate result based on the tools available, which is the hallmark of a well-designed AI system."
