Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **upscale a small drone landscape image by 4x while preserving compositional clarity and detail**. This involves single image super-resolution (SISR) to enhance the visual quality and make the entire landscape scene more discernible.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation of landscape features (terrain, vegetation, buildings)\n- Texture realism enhancement for natural elements\n- Edge sharpness maintenance for clear composition boundaries\n- Artifact minimization during upscaling\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system implements a **synapse-like branching network** where the input drone image flows through multiple specialized SISR pathways simultaneously. Each branch leverages different architectural strengths: SISR-DRN-L-4x for heavy detail reconstruction, SISR-IMDN-4x for efficient feature extraction, and SISR-DRN-S-4x for lightweight processing. The branches process the image in parallel, then merge through an adaptive fusion mechanism that selectively combines the best features from each pathway based on local image characteristics (texture density, edge complexity, homogeneous regions).\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the complementary strengths of the three SISR models from the provided papers:\n\n- **SISR-DRN-L-4x** ([arXiv:2003.07018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018)) provides the heavy-lifting capability for complex landscape details through its large network capacity.\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** ([arXiv:1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)) offers efficient multi-scale feature extraction ideal for diverse landscape elements.\n\n- **SISR-DRN-S-4x** ([arXiv:2003.07018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018)) ensures fast processing for homogeneous regions like sky and water.\n\nThe synaptic branching approach allows each model to contribute its strengths while the fusion module intelligently combines results, creating a more robust and higher-quality 4x upscaling than any single model could achieve alone.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enlarge a small drone landscape photo by 4×** to make the entire scene composition more discernible, while preserving terrain structure and enhancing natural texture.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Terrain shape preservation (hills, rivers, buildings)\n- Natural texture realism (trees, grass, earth)\n- Edge sharpness (between ground, water, structures)\n- Artifact suppression (no oversharpening, ringing)\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input image is passed through a **parallel synapse network** consisting of three different 4x SISR models:\n- **SISR-DRN-L-4x** focuses on reconstructing high-detail regions like forests, rooftops, and roads.\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** provides balanced super-resolution with efficient structure-texture enhancement.\n- **SISR-DRN-S-4x** offers fast, lightweight processing for smooth zones like sky or water.\n\nEach model outputs a 4x upscaled version. These results are then passed to an **Adaptive Fusion Module**, which generates per-region confidence maps to choose the best pixels from each model based on local structure (e.g., edges, flat areas, texture complexity). A final **refinement pass** suppresses artifacts and smooths transitions, producing a clean, photorealistic 4x landscape.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a 4x super-resolution on a small drone photograph of a landscape. The primary goal is to enhance the visual clarity of the entire scene, making the overall composition and its details more discernible.\n\nThis involves the following sub-goals:\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The upscaled image must accurately maintain the large-scale elements of the landscape, such as the shape of mountains, the course of rivers, and the layout of fields.\n*   **Texture Realism:** The model must generate plausible and realistic high-frequency details for natural textures like foliage, water, and rock surfaces, which are lost in the low-resolution source.\n*   **Artifact Suppression:** The process should minimize or eliminate common super-resolution artifacts (e.g., blurring, ringing, unrealistic repeating patterns) to ensure the resulting image looks natural and \"clear.\"\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a parallel-processing network where multiple specialized models work on the same input simultaneously. A final selection module then chooses the optimal output based on pre-defined heuristics derived from the models' known characteristics, ensuring both quality and robustness.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins when the user's low-resolution drone shot is ingested. Instead of a single processing path, the image is immediately routed via a **Synaptic Splitter** to two parallel modules.\n\n1.  **Path A (High-Fidelity):** This path uses the **SISR-DRN-L-4x** model. It is architected to produce the highest possible reconstruction quality, focusing on maximizing detail and clarity, which directly aligns with the user's primary request.\n2.  **Path B (Balanced / Robust Fallback):** This path uses the **SISR-IMDN-4x** model. This model is known for its excellent balance of performance and computational efficiency. It runs in parallel to provide a high-quality alternative.\n\nBoth modules generate a 4x upscaled image candidate. These two outputs then arrive at a **Synaptic Convergence & Selector** node. This node applies a simple but effective logic: it defaults to selecting the output from the High-Fidelity path (DRN-L). However, if that path fails or exceeds a computational time limit, the system seamlessly selects the output from the Balanced path (IMDN). This ensures the user receives a high-quality result reliably. The final selected image is then delivered as the output.\n\nThe **SISR-DRN-S-4x** model is intentionally excluded from the primary workflow because its lower reconstruction quality does not align with the user's goal of achieving the \"clearest\" possible image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.
