    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to harmonize the lighting and tone of a Photoshopped hoodie to naturally match the existing lighting conditions on a model's face and body. The sub-goals include:\n- **Lighting consistency**: Matching shadow direction, intensity, and color temperature\n- **Tone harmonization**: Adjusting brightness, contrast, and color balance\n- **Texture preservation**: Maintaining the hoodie's fabric details while adjusting appearance\n- **Natural integration**: Ensuring the composite looks realistic and seamless\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a synapse-like network where the input image branches into parallel analysis paths. One branch analyzes the existing lighting conditions from the model's face and exposed skin areas, while another branch isolates the Photoshopped hoodie region. These analyses converge into a harmonization module that uses Image Neural Radiance (INR) techniques to adjust the hoodie's appearance. The system then merges the harmonized hoodie back with the original image, creating a natural-looking composite where lighting and tone are consistent across all elements.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Harmonization-INR-RAW-HAdobe5K** model (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01681) as the core harmonization engine. INR (Image Neural Radiance) techniques are specifically designed for this type of lighting and appearance matching task, making them ideal for harmonizing composited elements.\n\nThe synaptic branching approach allows parallel analysis of both the reference lighting conditions (from the face) and the target region (hoodie), which is more efficient than sequential processing. The convergence at the harmonization module ensures that both lighting analysis and hoodie characteristics inform the final adjustment process.\n\nThe workflow specifically addresses the user's need for natural lighting and tone matching while preserving the hoodie's original texture and details - a key requirement for realistic photo compositing.",

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow to solve the user's image harmonization problem.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform **image harmonization**. Specifically, they need to adjust the brightness, contrast, and color of a foreground object (a photoshopped hoodie) to seamlessly match the lighting and tone of the background image (a model photo).\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Lighting and Tone Matching:** The primary goal is to make the hoodie's lighting appear as if it were part of the original scene.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The shape, folds, and details of the hoodie must be retained without distortion.\n*   **Texture Realism:** The fabric texture of the hoodie must be preserved.\n*   **Seamless Boundary:** The edges between the hoodie and the model's body/background must be blended naturally.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network. It takes a single input, branches it for parallel processing, and then merges the results for the final computation.\n\n---\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system receives the user's single composite image as input. Immediately, the workflow **branches into two parallel paths**.\n\n1.  **The Mask Generation Path:** One branch is dedicated to identifying *what* needs to be fixed. It uses a **Foreground Segmentation Module** to analyze the image and generate a precise binary mask that isolates the photoshopped hoodie from the rest of the image. This is a critical prerequisite for the main model.\n2.  **The Image Preservation Path:** The second branch is a simple passthrough that holds the original, unaltered composite image.\n\nAt a **synaptic merge point**, the outputs from both branches converge. The system now possesses the two distinct inputs required by the core harmonization model: the **original composite image** and the newly generated **foreground mask**.\n\nThese two data streams are then fed into the **`Harmonization-INR-RAW-HAdobe5K`** model. This model uses the mask to understand which pixels belong to the foreground (hoodie) and which belong to the background. It then intelligently adjusts the lighting and color properties of the foreground region to match the characteristics of the background, as described in its reference paper.\n\nThe final output is a single, harmonized image where the hoodie looks naturally integrated into the original photo.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS-style workflow is dictated by the specific capabilities and requirements of the provided models.\n\n*   **Chosen Model: `Harmonization-INR-RAW-HAdobe5K`**\n    This is the only relevant model for the user's task. The reference paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.01681) explicitly states its purpose: \"Image harmonization aims to adjust the foreground of a composite image to make it compatible with the background.\" This directly matches the user's request.\n\n*   **Justification for Branching:**\n    The paper's methodology section clarifies that the model **requires two inputs: a composite image and its corresponding foreground mask.** The user only provides the composite image. A simple linear pipeline is therefore impossible. The CNAPS design is necessary to create this missing input. The workflow must branch to generate the foreground mask in a parallel process before merging it with the original image for the final harmonization step. This branching architecture makes the system robust and autonomous.\n\n*   **Excluded Models:**\n    *   **`Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-Realisian`**: This is a text-to-image generation model. The user wants to *edit* an existing composite image, not generate a new one from a text prompt. This model is fundamentally unsuited for the task.\n    *   **`WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze`**: This model is designed for a completely different problem domain—removing atmospheric haze. The user's issue is a lighting mismatch from a digital composite, not a weather-related artifact. Applying this model would be incorrect and yield poor results."
