    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to transform handmade craft photos by applying mosaic texture effects to create artistic, art-like appearances. The goal is to take existing craft photographs and overlay or blend them with mosaic patterns to achieve a fine art aesthetic.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation of the original craft objects\n- Realistic mosaic texture application\n- Artistic style enhancement while maintaining craft recognizability\n- Seamless integration of mosaic patterns with craft photography\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a branching neural network where the input craft photo flows through multiple pathways simultaneously. The main branch uses neural style transfer to apply mosaic textures directly to the original image, while parallel branches generate enhanced versions and reference materials. The NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic model serves as the primary transformation engine, applying mosaic patterns while preserving structural details. The two Stable Diffusion models work in parallel to generate mosaic-style reference images and enhanced craft representations that can be used for texture guidance and quality refinement. The outputs from all branches merge through a weighted blending process, where the style-transferred result is refined using the generated references to achieve optimal mosaic integration and artistic quality.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis synaptic CNAPS workflow is ideal for stylizing handmade craft photos with mosaic texture:\n\n- **NST-fast-neural-style-mosaic** ensures the stylistic transformation remains efficient and retains content structure.\n- **Text-to-image reference generation (majicMix and GhostMix)** supplies richer style cues to balance the sometimes rigid or flat look of pure style transfer.\n- **Fusion module** bridges artistic transformation with perceptual realism, creating output suitable for visual presentation or exhibition.\n\nBy allowing modular enhancements in a parallel structure and combining outputs through synaptic integration, the system achieves both stylistic vibrancy and structural fidelity.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of a CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to transform a standard photograph of a handmade craft into a stylized image that appears to be a mosaic artwork.\n\nThis involves the following critical sub-goals:\n*   **Style Application:** The primary goal is to apply a convincing \"mosaic texture\" to the image.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The original shape, form, and key details of the handmade craft must be clearly preserved and recognizable in the final output.\n*   **Subject Isolation:** The mosaic effect should ideally be applied to the craft item itself, potentially leaving the background untouched for a more professional and focused result.\n*   **Artistic Quality:** The final output should be aesthetically pleasing and achieve the user's subjective goal of looking like a \"work of art.\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the user's input image along multiple, parallel paths to generate distinct artistic options, which are then presented for a final, curated output.\n\nThe process begins when the user uploads their **Handmade Craft Photo**. This image immediately enters an initial processing module, the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, which identifies and creates a precise mask of the main subject (the craft).\n\nFrom here, the system **branches into two parallel synaptic pathways**, each designed to generate the mosaic style using a different state-of-the-art technique. The original image and the subject mask are passed to both branches.\n\n*   **Branch A (Instruction-Based Editing):** This path uses **InstructPix2Pix**. It takes the original image and a direct text command, \"add a mosaic texture,\" to perform an in-place edit. This branch is fast and directly follows the user's semantic instruction.\n*   **Branch B (Structure-Guided Generation):** This path uses **ControlNet** for a more granular and structurally faithful transformation. It first generates a Canny edge map from the original photo to capture its precise structure. This edge map then guides a powerful text-to-image model (like `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic`) with a descriptive prompt like \"a beautiful mosaic of a handmade object, intricate tiles, detailed grout work\" to generate a new mosaic image that strictly adheres to the original craft's shape.\n\nThe outputs from both branches (`Result_A` and `Result_B`) then **merge** at a composition node. Here, the segmentation mask generated by SAM in the first step is used to seamlessly combine the stylized craft from each result with the original, unedited background.\n\nFinally, these two high-quality, fully-composited options are presented to the user for **Curation and Selection**. This final step acknowledges the subjective nature of art and empowers the user to choose the output that best matches their vision, completing the workflow.\n\n### B.
