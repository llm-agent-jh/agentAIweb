Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **synapse-like branching** concept by:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple SD models process the same input simultaneously, mimicking neural pathway redundancy\n2. **Specialization**: Each model brings different strengths (colorful enhancement, realistic correction, alternative interpretation)\n3. **Convergence**: The merge module acts like a neural integration point, combining the best aspects of each pathway\n\nThe workflow is specifically designed for **ad image enhancement** where visual impact is crucial, making the multi-pathway approach valuable for achieving optimal color correction results.\n\n**Note**: While specific papers aren't provided for these models, the workflow design follows established CNAPS principles of distributed processing and intelligent merging for enhanced output quality.",
    "llm_b": "# 1. Core Task\nThe user wants a color-corrected version of a prototype ad image they created. The image should maintain the original subject, composition, and realism, while enhancing color and lighting.\n\nSub-goals:\n- Structure Preservation: Maintain original layout and spatial relationships.\n- Subject Preservation: Do not change the central object or message of the ad.\n- Color Enhancement: Improve color vibrancy, contrast, and realism.\n- Realism: Final image should appear professionally enhanced, not artificial.\n\n# 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n## A. High-Level Overview\nThe system begins by analyzing the user’s `prototype_ad_image` using a vision-language model (BLIP-2), which generates a detailed text caption describing the content. This caption drives two parallel branches:\n\n**Branch 1 (Direct Instructional Editing)**:\nThe original image and an editing instruction (“make colors more vibrant”) are passed to **InstructPix2Pix**, which edits the image conservatively while preserving structure.\n\n**Branch 2 (Re-generation with Controlled Prompting)**:\nUsing the caption, a detailed enhanced prompt is created (e.g., “a color-corrected photo of a red sports car...”) and used by **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful** to generate a new image from scratch.\n\nBoth image outputs are evaluated by **CLIP**, which computes similarity scores to the original image and the intended goal. The candidate with the higher weighted score is chosen.\n\n## B.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to improve the color and lighting of a prototype ad image they have created. The primary goal is **color correction and enhancement** while strictly **preserving the original composition, subject, and structure** of the input image.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The layout and objects in the ad must remain unchanged.\n*   **Content Preservation:** The specific subject (e.g., a product, a person) must be identical.\n*   **Color Enhancement:** The colors should be made more vibrant, balanced, or professional, as implied by \"color corrected.\"\n*   **Plausibility:** The final image should look realistic and high-quality.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow operates like a biological synapse, where an initial signal (the user's image) is analyzed and then triggers multiple parallel processing pathways.\n\nFirst, the input `prototype_ad_image` is fed into a **BLIP-2** vision-language model. This acts as the system's \"sensory neuron,\" analyzing the image content and generating a detailed text description (e.g., \"a blue sedan parked on a city street at night\").\n\nThis text description, along with the original image, then branches into two parallel \"synaptic pathways\":\n\n1.  **The Editing Pathway:** This is the most direct and conservative route. It uses **InstructPix2Pix**, a model designed for instruction-based image editing. It takes the original image and a direct command like \"make the colors more vibrant\" to produce an edited version that closely preserves the original structure.\n\n2.  **The Re-generation Pathway:** This is a more creative and potentially higher-quality route. It uses the `base_description_text` from BLIP-2 to create a rich prompt. This prompt is then fed into the **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful** model to generate a brand new image from scratch, optimized for excellent color. This path risks altering the composition but may achieve superior aesthetics.\n\nFinally, the outputs from both pathways—the `edited_image` and the `regenerated_image`—converge at a \"synaptic junction.\" Here, the **CLIP** model acts as a judge. It evaluates both candidates by measuring two things:\na) How structurally similar they are to the **original input image**.\nb) How well they match a **text description of the final goal** (e.g., \"A professional, color-corrected photo of a blue sedan...\").\n\nA decision logic module then weighs these CLIP scores, prioritizing structural similarity, and selects the superior candidate as the final output.\n\n### B.
