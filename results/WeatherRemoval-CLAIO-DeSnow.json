    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to remove atmospheric weather degradations (snow specks and frost marks) from a window scene image to restore clear visibility of the outdoor scene. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Remove snow particle occlusions while preserving underlying scene structure\n- Eliminate frost pattern artifacts without losing window/scene detail\n- Maintain realistic lighting and color consistency of the cleared scene\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the hazy input image through a **branching weather removal network** where the input simultaneously feeds into specialized weather degradation modules. The WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze module handles atmospheric haze reduction, while WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeSnow specifically targets snow particle removal. These modules work in parallel, each producing intermediate cleaned outputs that preserve different aspects of scene clarity. The outputs then merge through an adaptive fusion mechanism that combines the best restoration qualities from each branch, producing a final image with comprehensive weather artifact removal while maintaining scene authenticity.\n\n### B.

Module Specifications\n\n**Input Module:**\n- **Input:** Raw RGB image with snow/frost degradation\n- **Output:** Normalized feature maps for weather analysis\n\n**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze:**\n- **Input:** Feature maps from input processing\n- **Function:** Removes atmospheric haze and improves visibility\n- **Output:** Haze-corrected RGB image with enhanced contrast\n\n**WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeSnow:**\n- **Input:** Feature maps from input processing  \n- **Function:** Specifically targets snow particle removal and frost pattern elimination\n- **Output:** Snow-cleared RGB image with preserved scene details\n\n**Adaptive Fusion Layer:**\n- **Input:** Parallel outputs from DeHaze and DeSnow modules\n- **Function:** Intelligently combines complementary restoration results\n- **Output:** Final restored image with comprehensive weather removal\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture leverages **parallel processing** of different weather degradation types rather than sequential processing, which is more effective because:\n\n1. **Specialized Processing:** Each WeatherRemoval-CLAIO module targets specific degradation patterns (haze vs. snow particles), allowing for optimized removal strategies.\n\n2. **Preservation of Scene Information:** The branching approach ensures that while one module removes snow artifacts, the other maintains atmospheric clarity, preventing over-processing that could damage scene details.\n\n3. **Adaptive Integration:** The fusion layer can dynamically weight contributions from each branch based on local image characteristics, ensuring optimal restoration quality across different regions of the image.\n\nThe modular design allows for **synapse-like flexibility** where different weather conditions can activate different processing pathways, making the system robust to varying degradation severities and types.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **remove snow specks and frost marks from a hazy window scene**, ensuring that the **outdoor view becomes clean, clear, and visually natural**.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Suppression of snowflake artifacts and frost occlusions\n- Restoration of structural details in the background scene\n- Avoidance of over-smoothing or hallucination\n- Balanced contrast and visibility through haze\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input photo, affected by both snow and frost haze, is routed into two parallel branches. The first branch uses a snow removal module to suppress localized snow specks, particularly the granular white noise-like particles.\n\nThe second branch applies a dehazing module to eliminate the frost-induced veil and improve global contrast. These processed outputs are then passed into a fusion stage that integrates the fine-grain detail preservation from the desnowing path with the global structural clarity from dehazing.\n\nAn optional derain module is conditionally triggered if streak-like melt patterns (often confused with raindrops) are detected on the glass surface.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeSnow**  \n  Specially tailored to remove granular snowflakes and specks that degrade visibility without affecting background integrity.\n\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeHaze**  \n  Addresses the frost haze, improving contrast and revealing background detail obscured by atmospheric diffusion.\n\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain**  \n  Optional module that engages only if streak-like water trails are present due to melting frost, ensuring glass clarity.\n\nThe CNAPS architecture branches into multiple cleanup modules, each handling specific weather artifacts (snow, haze, rain-like streaks). The fusion module integrates their strengths, ensuring a final output that is visually coherent and artifact-free.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to restore a photograph by removing multiple, layered weather-related degradations. The primary goal is to produce a clean, clear version of the scene visible through the window, as if the weather effects were not present.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Particulate Removal:** Eliminate small, bright, occluding artifacts, which include both \"snow specks\" and \"frost marks.\"\n*   **Atmospheric Correction:** Remove the \"hazy\" effect, which reduces contrast and washes out colors across the scene.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the integrity of the underlying scene, such as the window frame, trees, and other objects, without introducing distortion.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Ensure that the final image has natural-looking textures where the degradations were removed.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the input signal branches to specialized modules whose outputs are then integrated for a final, comprehensive result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the single hazy, snowy, and frosty input image and immediately routes it down two parallel processing branches, much like a neuron sending signals down multiple axons.\n\n*   **Branch A (Particulate Removal):** This branch is dedicated to removing physical occlusions. It uses the `DeSnow` model to identify and inpaint the areas covered by snow specks and frost marks. The output is an image that is free of these particles but remains hazy.\n*   **Branch B (Atmospheric Correction):** This branch runs concurrently and is dedicated to correcting the atmospheric distortion. It uses the `DeHaze` model to restore contrast and color. The output is an image where the haze is gone, but the snow and frost specks remain, potentially sharpened or altered by the dehazing process.\n\nThe key synaptic integration step occurs after these parallel branches complete. The output from **Branch A** (the de-snowed, hazy image) is determined to be the ideal input for a final atmospheric correction pass. This is because removing occlusions *before* correcting atmospheric haze prevents the `DeHaze` model from creating artifacts around the specks. The system then channels this intermediate result into the `DeHaze` model one more time to produce the final, clean image. The output of Branch B serves as a valuable diagnostic tool, but is not used in the final image composition.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.
