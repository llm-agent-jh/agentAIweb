    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a dessert photo containing cupcakes by enlarging the text 4x while maintaining visibility of both text and ingredient details. This involves **super-resolution image enhancement** with specific focus on text legibility preservation.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation of cupcake details and textures\n- Text clarity and readability enhancement at 4x scale\n- Maintaining realistic texture and color fidelity\n- Preserving ingredient detail visibility\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-pathway super-resolution network** where the input dessert photo branches into two specialized processing streams. The primary pathway uses SISR-IMDN-4x for general image enhancement, while a parallel pathway uses SISR-ESRT-4x for text-focused super-resolution. Both models process the same input simultaneously but with different optimization focuses. The outputs are then intelligently merged through a weighted combination that prioritizes text regions from the ESRT pathway while preserving overall image quality from the IMDN pathway. This synaptic approach ensures both text legibility and ingredient detail preservation.\n\n### B.

Module Details\n\n**Module 1: SISR-IMDN-4x**\n- **Input:** Original dessert photo (RGB image)\n- **Function:** General 4x super-resolution using Information Multi-Distillation Network\n- **Output:** Enhanced image with preserved textures and ingredient details\n- **Reference:** https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1\n\n**Module 2: SISR-ESRT-4x** \n- **Input:** Same original dessert photo (RGB image)\n- **Function:** Text-optimized 4x super-resolution \n- **Output:** Enhanced image with superior text clarity and sharpness\n\n**Module 3: Intelligent Merge**\n- **Input:** Both enhanced images from parallel branches\n- **Function:** Weighted combination prioritizing text regions from ESRT while maintaining IMDN's overall quality\n- **Output:** Final 4x enlarged image with optimal text legibility and ingredient detail preservation\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **complementary strengths** of both super-resolution approaches:\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** excels at preserving natural textures and details (crucial for ingredient visibility) through its multi-distillation architecture as described in the paper\n- **SISR-ESRT-4x** provides superior text enhancement capabilities\n- The **synaptic branching** allows simultaneous processing rather than sequential, reducing computational overhead\n- The **intelligent merge** ensures the final output maximizes both text readability and ingredient detail preservation\n\nThe workflow specifically addresses the user's dual requirement of text enlargement AND ingredient detail visibility by treating them as parallel optimization objectives rather than competing constraints.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enlarge a photo of cupcakes by 4×** so that both the **small text on the cupcakes** and the **ingredient textures (e.g., frosting, crumbs)** are clearly visible.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Text readability and sharpness\n- Natural texture restoration of desserts\n- 4× super-resolution without artifact introduction\n- Visual coherence across image regions\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow begins by routing the low-res cupcake photo into two specialized processing branches:\n\n- **Branch A – Text-focused path:**  \n  The input image is sent through `SISR-ESRT-4x`, a Transformer-based model ideal for capturing long-range dependencies like characters and lines. This branch produces an image with sharpened and legible text.\n\n- **Branch B – Texture-focused path:**  \n  Simultaneously, the image is processed using `SISR-IMDN-4x`, a CNN-based model known for efficient and realistic texture restoration. This output preserves natural ingredient appearance such as frosting, sprinkles, and cake edges.\n\nA **region-aware fusion module** then merges the two outputs, selecting pixels from ESRT in text-dense regions and from IMDN in background/ingredient regions. The result is a 4× enhanced image that clearly reveals both text and cupcake texture.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **SISR-ESRT-4x** is selected for the text enhancement branch because its Transformer-based attention is well suited to reconstructing structured components like letters, logos, or packaging labels.\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-4x** ([IMDN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)) is ideal for cupcake surfaces, frosting, and crumbs. Its lightweight, multi-distillation architecture captures complex visual textures while maintaining sharp boundaries.\n\n- The **fusion strategy** mimics CNAPS-style reasoning: each model focuses on a different perceptual domain (text vs. texture), and their outputs are merged through a synaptic compositing module based on region relevance.\n\n- **Txt2Img-HuggingFace-prompthero-openjourney-v4** is excluded because the user’s request is image enhancement, not image generation.\n\nThis modular design ensures that both user goals—text clarity and ingredient detail—are independently optimized and seamlessly integrated.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using the provided models.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform a 4x super-resolution on a photograph of cupcakes, with the primary objective of making small, illegible text on the cupcakes clear and readable.\n\nThis involves two distinct sub-goals that must be achieved simultaneously:\n*   **Text Legibility:** The enlarged text must be sharp, coherent, and easily readable. This is the highest priority.\n*   **Texture Realism & Coherence:** The non-text parts of the image (e.g., frosting, cake, wrapper) must also be upscaled realistically, preserving their natural textures without introducing artifacts. The final image must be a seamless composite.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis task is a perfect candidate for a CNAPS-style workflow because the sub-goals (text legibility vs. texture realism) benefit from different types of specialized models. A single model might compromise one goal for the other. This branching network allows us to use the best tool for each specific part of the problem and then intelligently combine the results.\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe workflow begins by taking the user's low-resolution dessert photo as input. The system first identifies the specific region containing the text that needs to be enhanced. This creates a \"text mask.\"\n\nFrom here, the process branches into two parallel synaptic paths:\n\n1.  **The \"Structure & Text\" Path:** The input image is routed to the **SISR-ESRT-4x** model. As a Transformer-based architecture, ESRT is exceptionally good at recognizing and reconstructing structured patterns with long-range dependencies, such as letterforms. It processes the image with a focus on producing sharp, coherent text.\n2.  **The \"General Texture\" Path:** In parallel, the input image is routed to the **SISR-IMDN-4x** model. This lightweight CNN is highly effective at general-purpose super-resolution, excelling at recreating plausible, realistic textures like frosting and cake crumb.\n\nAfter both models complete their 4x upscaling, the workflow enters the integration phase. A compositor module uses the upscaled text mask to merge the two outputs. It takes the sharp, legible text from the ESRT output and seamlessly blends it onto the realistic, textured background from the IMDN output.\n\nThe final output is a single, high-resolution 4x image that combines the strengths of both models, satisfying the user's request for both readable text and a high-quality photo.\n\n### B.

Justification of Design Choices\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture was deliberately chosen over a simple linear pipeline to achieve a superior result by leveraging model specialization.\n\n1.  **Branching Rationale (Why CNAPS?):** Text and natural image textures are fundamentally different data types. Text is structured, with sharp edges and geometric consistency. Frosting is stochastic and organic. A single super-resolution model often excels at one but not the other. Forcing one model to do both can lead to blurry text or unnatural, blocky textures. By branching the workflow, we can apply a specialized model to each domain, a core principle of advanced AI systems.\n\n2.  **Model Selection for Branch A (Text):**\n    *   **Model:** **SISR-ESRT-4x**\n    *   **Justification:** The name \"ESRT\" implies an **Efficient Super-Resolution Transformer**. While its paper is not provided, Transformer architectures are renowned for their attention mechanisms, which capture long-range dependencies and contextual information. This is ideal for reconstructing text, where the shape of a letter is defined by the global relationship of its constituent pixels, not just local neighbors. ESRT is chosen for this path to ensure the highest possible legibility for the final text.\n\n3.  **Model Selection for Branch B (Texture):**\n    *   **Model:** **SISR-IMDN-4x**\n    *   **Justification:** The paper for the **Information Multi-distillation Network (IMDN)** (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) describes it as a \"lightweight\" network that effectively extracts hierarchical features. Its CNN-based design is well-suited for general image restoration and capturing the complex, fine-grained textures of the cupcake and background. Its efficiency makes it perfect for processing the larger, non-critical background areas of the image, providing a realistic base layer for the final composite.\n\n4.  **Integration Module (Compositor):** The final merge step is critical. By using a mask, we ensure a clean \"synaptic fusion\" of the two specialized outputs. This prevents artifacts and creates a single, coherent image where the text from Branch A is perfectly placed within the realistic context from Branch B.\n\n5.  **Excluded Model:**\n    *   **Txt2Img-HuggingFace-prompthero-openjourney-v4:** This model is correctly excluded as it is a text-to-image *generation* model. The user's task is *image enhancement* (super-resolution) of an existing photo, not the creation of a new one from a text prompt. It is functionally irrelevant to the stated goal."
