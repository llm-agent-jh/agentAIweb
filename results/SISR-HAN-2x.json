    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance blurry travel photos of mountains and trees by deblurring them and enlarging them by 2x while preserving fine details**. This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Deblurring**: Remove motion blur or focus blur from the original images\n- **Super-resolution**: Upscale the images by 2x while maintaining or enhancing detail clarity\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintain the natural textures of mountains and trees\n- **Detail enhancement**: Ensure fine details become clearer rather than just larger\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch synaptic network** where the input image flows through two specialized processing paths that eventually merge. The **primary deblurring branch** uses MIMO-UNet to remove blur while the **secondary refinement branch** uses MSSNet for complementary blur removal and detail enhancement. Both branches process the image in parallel, then their outputs are intelligently fused. The merged result then flows to a **super-resolution module** that upscales by 2x while preserving the enhanced details from the deblurring stage.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Input Router**\n- **Input**: Raw blurry images (RGB, various resolutions)\n- **Function**: Analyzes blur characteristics and routes to appropriate processing branches\n- **Output**: Preprocessed images + blur metadata\n\n**Module 2: Primary Branch (MIMO-UNet)**\n- **Model**: Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur\n- **Input**: Original blurry image\n- **Function**: Removes motion blur using multi-input multi-output architecture\n- **Output**: Deblurred image + intermediate feature maps\n- **Reference**: [ICCV 2021 Paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)\n\n**Module 3: Secondary Branch (MSSNet)**\n- **Model**: Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR\n- **Input**: Original blurry image\n- **Function**: Complementary deblurring with focus on fine detail preservation\n- **Output**: Refined image + detail enhancement maps\n- **Reference**: [MSSNet Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)\n\n**Module 4: Feature Fusion**\n- **Input**: Outputs from both deblurring branches\n- **Function**: Intelligently combines results using adaptive weighting based on local image characteristics\n- **Output**: Optimally deblurred image ready for upscaling\n\n**Module 5: Super-Resolution**\n- **Input**: Fused deblurred image\n- **Function**: Upscales by 2x while preserving enhanced details\n- **Output**: Final 2x enlarged, deblurred travel photos\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis **synapse-like branching architecture** is optimal because:\n\n1. **Parallel Processing**: The MIMO-UNet and MSSNet models have complementary strengths - MIMO-UNet excels at motion blur removal (common in travel photography) while MSSNet provides superior detail preservation for natural textures like mountains and trees.\n\n2. **Adaptive Fusion**: Rather than a simple linear pipeline, the branching allows the system to leverage both models' strengths and compensate for individual weaknesses through intelligent merging.\n\n3. **Preservation of Enhancement**: By performing deblurring before super-resolution, the system ensures that the 2x enlargement amplifies clear details rather than blur artifacts.\n\n4. **Real-world Optimization**: Both selected models (MIMO-UNet and MSSNet) are specifically trained on real blur datasets, making them ideal for actual travel photography scenarios.\n\nThe **CNAPS-style design** ensures that the enhancement process is both robust and adaptive, providing superior results compared to a single-model approach for the user's specific travel photography enhancement needs.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to improve the quality of their blurry travel photos of natural landscapes (mountains, trees). The primary goal is to **remove blur and restore fine details**, with a secondary goal of **enlarging the image by 2x** to make these restored details more visible.\n\nKey sub-goals include:\n*   **Blur Removal:** Correct for motion or focus blur common in handheld photography.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Generate natural-looking textures for organic elements like foliage and rock faces, avoiding an artificial or \"plastic\" look.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the overall composition and large-scale structures of the mountains and trees.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow operates like a biological synapse, where an incoming signal (the blurry photo) is split and processed through multiple parallel pathways simultaneously to test different hypotheses for the best restoration.\n\nThe input blurry image is fed into two main branches:\n\n1.  **Deblur-First Branch:** This path hypothesizes that explicitly removing blur *before* enlargement yields the best results. The input is sent to two different state-of-the-art deblurring models (MIMO-UNet and MSSNet) in parallel. The outputs of these models—two distinct deblurred images—are then each passed through two different super-resolution models (BSRGAN and Real-ESRGAN). This creates a total of four potential outcomes from this branch.\n2.  **Direct Blind Super-Resolution Branch:** This path tests the hypothesis that modern blind super-resolution models can handle both deblurring and upscaling in a single step more effectively. The original blurry image is sent directly to the BSRGAN and Real-ESRGAN models.\n\nFinally, all six resulting 2x resolution candidate images are converged at a **Quality Assessor** module. This module acts as the neuron's decision-making center, using objective image quality metrics (like sharpness and naturalness) to score each candidate. The highest-scoring image is selected as the final output, ensuring the user receives the best possible result from the available tools.\n\n### B.
