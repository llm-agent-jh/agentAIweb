Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **upscale an outdoor mural photograph by 3x while preserving and enhancing artistic details**, specifically ensuring colors and lines remain clear and visually coherent. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation (maintaining architectural and artistic line integrity)\n- Texture realism (preserving paint textures and surface details)\n- Color fidelity (accurate color reproduction without artifacts)\n- Detail enhancement (revealing fine artistic elements obscured by low resolution)\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **competitive-collaborative ensemble** where the input mural image branches into three parallel super-resolution pathways, each leveraging different architectural strengths. The IMDN branch focuses on information distillation for fine detail recovery, the HAN branch uses holistic attention for global coherence, and the CARN-M branch provides efficient cascaded refinement. These three enhanced outputs converge into a dynamic fusion module that performs pixel-level quality assessment and selective blending, creating a final 3x upscaled image that combines the best characteristics from each approach.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\n- **SISR-IMDN-3x** ([arXiv:1909.11856v1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1)) is efficient and highly capable of preserving small textural details due to its multi-distillation feature blocks, making it well-suited for artistic murals with intricate brushwork.\n\n- **SISR-HAN-3x** ([arXiv:2008.08767](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08767)) uses channel-spatial and layer attention to capture holistic image dependencies. This model ensures that mural color composition and contextual integrity are preserved at high fidelity.\n\n- **SISR-CARN-M-3x** ([arXiv:1803.08664](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08664)) brings recursive, mobile-efficient residual refinement—particularly effective for structural edge enhancement in murals painted on rough surfaces.\n\n- The **fusion module** mimics neural integration: texture from IMDN, color fidelity from HAN, and edge clarity from CARN-M are selectively combined using adaptive quality maps. This design reflects a CNAPS-style parallel-specialist architecture where distinct perceptual paths contribute to a unified result.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, leveraging the specific strengths of the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to upscale a low-resolution photograph of an outdoor mural by a factor of 3. The primary goal is to restore and enhance the fine artistic details, ensuring that the final image has sharp, clear lines and vibrant, accurate colors that were lost in the small version.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n\n*   **Scale Increase:** Magnify the image to 3x its original dimensions.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the integrity of the mural's primary composition and large-scale lines.\n*   **Detail & Texture Restoration:** Reconstruct fine-grained details like brushstrokes, paint texture, and the underlying wall surface.\n*   **Color Fidelity:** Enhance color vibrancy and clarity without introducing unnatural artifacts.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThis workflow operates on a principle of parallel-path processing and guided fusion, inspired by how neural pathways can process information for different purposes simultaneously before integrating the results.\n\nThe input low-resolution (LR) mural photo is fed into two parallel branches simultaneously:\n\n1.  **The Fast Structural Path:** This branch uses a lightweight, efficient model (SISR-IMDN) to quickly generate a 3x upscaled image. Its main purpose is to establish a structurally sound and artifact-free baseline, preserving the mural's overall form and major lines.\n2.  **The High-Fidelity Detail Path:** This branch uses a more computationally intensive but powerful attention-based model (SISR-HAN). Its purpose is to meticulously reconstruct the complex textures, subtle color gradations, and intricate details by considering the relationships between different features across the entire image.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches—a `Base Upscale` and a `Detail Upscale`—are then sent to a **Guidance & Merging Module**. This module calculates a \"Detail Map\" by finding the difference between the two versions. This map highlights areas where the high-fidelity model found significantly more detail. Finally, the module intelligently fuses the two images, using the Detail Map to layer the rich textures from the HAN output onto the stable structure of the IMDN output.\n\nThe result is a final image that combines the structural integrity of the fast model with the superior artistic detail of the attention-based model, directly achieving the user's goal.\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly chosen to overcome the inherent trade-offs in single-model solutions and directly addresses the user's multi-faceted request for both clarity and detail.\n\n1.  **Rationale for Branching:** A single SISR model must balance performance, speed, and memory. By branching, we can assign specialized tasks to models best suited for them. The user wants \"clear lines\" (structure) *and* \"artistic details\" (texture), which are distinct challenges. This parallel design allows us to tackle both optimally.\n\n2.  **Selection of SISR-IMDN-3x for Branch A (Structure):**\n    The IMDN paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) introduces a **lightweight** model using an \"information multi-distillation block (IMDB).\" Its key strength is efficiency, as it \"distills\" essential feature information while discarding redundant features. This makes it perfect for quickly generating a clean, structurally sound baseline for the mural without the computational overhead of more complex models. It provides the \"clear lines\" the user wants.\n\n3.  **Selection of SISR-HAN-3x for Branch B (Detail):**\n    The HAN paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08767) proposes a **Holistic Attention Network** that learns feature interdependencies by \"modeling correlations among layers, channels, and positions.\" This is crucial for restoring the \"artistic details\" of a mural. The model's Layer Attention Module (LAM) and Channel-Spatial Attention Module (CSAM) allow it to capture the non-local relationships that define complex textures, brushstrokes, and subtle color shifts, which a simpler model might miss. This branch provides the rich \"colors and details.\"\n\n4.  **Rationale for the Guidance & Merging Module:**\n    This is the core of the synaptic architecture. Instead of naively averaging the outputs, which would dilute the strengths of both, this module performs an intelligent fusion. The Detail Map identifies precisely *where* the powerful HAN model added value over the faster IMDN model. The guided fusion process then acts like a targeted enhancement, seamlessly integrating the fine textures from HAN onto the robust structural foundation from IMDN. This ensures the final image is both sharp and richly detailed, fulfilling all sub-goals of the user's request.\n\n*(Note: SISR-CARN-M-3x, being another lightweight model focused on efficiency, could be a valid substitute for SISR-IMDN in Branch A. The core principle of pairing a fast structural model with a powerful detail-oriented model remains the same.)*"

    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This is the winning response due to its superior workflow design and reasoning. Instead of a simple parallel ensemble, it proposes a more sophisticated and intelligent two-path system (Fast Structure vs. High-Fidelity Detail).

This demonstrates a deeper level of architectural thinking and better fulfills the spirit of a CNAPS-style workflow with specific, guided integration. The reasoning for every choice is exceptionally clear and well-justified."
