    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **detect and identify fashion accessories** (belts, scarves, necklaces) within an input image. The primary goal is **object detection and classification** of specific accessory categories, with sub-goals including:\n- Accurate localization of accessories within the image\n- Classification of detected objects into specific accessory types\n- Confidence scoring for each detection\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-pathway detection network** where the input image flows through two complementary analysis branches. The **primary pathway** uses a specialized fashion object detector (YOLOS-Fashionpedia) to identify and localize accessories with bounding boxes and class labels. Simultaneously, a **secondary validation pathway** employs a general-purpose classifier (ResNet-50) to provide additional confidence scoring and feature extraction for the detected regions. The two pathways merge their outputs through a **confidence fusion module** that combines detection scores with classification confidence to produce final, validated accessory detections with enhanced reliability.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: YOLOS-Fashionpedia Detector**\n- **Input**: RGB image tensor (3, H, W)\n- **Processing**: Vision transformer-based object detection specialized for fashion items\n- **Output**: \n  ```json\n  {\n    \"detections\": [\n      {\"class\": \"belt\", \"bbox\": [x1,y1,x2,y2], \"confidence\": 0.85},\n      {\"class\": \"scarf\", \"bbox\": [x1,y1,x2,y2], \"confidence\": 0.72}\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Module 2: ResNet-50 Classifier** \n- **Input**: Full image tensor (3, 224, 224)\n- **Processing**: Deep residual network feature extraction and classification\n- **Output**:\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"features\": [2048-dim feature vector],\n    \"top_classes\": [\"fashion\", \"person\", \"clothing\"],\n    \"confidence\": 0.91\n  }\n  ```\n\n**Module 3: Confidence Fusion**\n- **Input**: Detection results + Classification features\n- **Processing**: Weighted confidence scoring based on detection confidence and global image context\n- **Output**: Final validated accessory detections with enhanced confidence scores\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic design** leverages the complementary strengths of specialized and general-purpose models:\n\n- **YOLOS-Fashionpedia** (valentinafeve-yolos-fashionpedia) provides precise fashion-specific object detection capabilities, directly addressing the user's need for accessory identification with spatial localization.\n\n- **ResNet-50** (microsoft-resnet-50) from the seminal paper \"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition\" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) offers robust feature extraction and general classification confidence that can validate and enhance the specialized detector's outputs.\n\nThe **branching architecture** ensures redundancy and cross-validation, while the **fusion module** creates a synapse-like integration point that combines specialized detection with general visual understanding, resulting in more reliable accessory detection than either model could achieve independently.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to analyze a fashion image and identify specific accessories—belts, scarves, and necklaces—by performing object detection and filtering only the requested classes.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Detect all fashion items in the image\n- Localize and classify relevant accessories\n- Filter results to only include belts, scarves, and necklaces\n- Present a structured summary with object type, count, and location\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input image flows through a YOLOS-based object detection model trained on Fashionpedia, detecting all fashion-related items. Simultaneously, the user's query is parsed for target accessory categories. Both signals are then merged in a synaptic filter module, which selects only the requested classes from the detection output. The final stage synthesizes a human-readable report describing how many of each accessory was found, along with their bounding boxes.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Module Details\n\n**1. ObjDet-HuggingFace-valentinafeve-yolos-fashionpedia**\n- **Input:** RGB fashion image\n- **Process:** Detects and classifies over 20 fashion item categories with bounding boxes\n- **Output Format:** List of detected objects with class label, confidence, and coordinates\n  ```json\n  [\n    {\"label\": \"belt\", \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"confidence\": 0.87},\n    {\"label\": \"scarf\", \"bbox\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"confidence\": 0.81}\n  ]\n  ```\n\n**2. Classification-HuggingFace-microsoft-resnet-50 (optional)**\n- **Input:** Full image\n- **Process:** Provides high-level classification (e.g., “fashion”) as a verification step\n- **Justification:** Adds contextual confidence, but not required for item-level detection\n- **Reference:** [ResNet Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385)\n\n**3. Synaptic Filter Module**\n- **Input:** List of detections + parsed query keywords\n- **Process:** Filters to retain only user-requested items (\"belt\", \"scarf\", \"necklace\")\n- **Output:** Refined list of relevant accessories with class, box, and score\n\n**4. Output Composer**\n- **Input:** Filtered detection list\n- **Process:** Converts detections into structured natural language summary and visual annotation\n- **Example Output:**\n  ```\n  Summary:\n  - Belts detected: 1\n  - Scarves detected: 0\n  - Necklaces detected: 2\n\n  Bounding boxes:\n  - Necklace: [150, 300, 240, 360]\n  - Belt: [200, 400, 360, 430]\n  ```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS workflow integrates detection and query-parsing into a modular, synapse-like structure:\n\n- **YOLOS-Fashionpedia** is the best-fit model, trained for fashion accessory detection and able to recognize belts, scarves, and necklaces from real-world fashion images【251†source】.\n- **ResNet-50** is optional, offering general classification to confirm image context【251†source】.\n- **NST-style models** are excluded, as they stylize rather than detect.\n\nThe synaptic aggregator module acts like a decision junction, merging detection data with the parsed intent from the user. This approach delivers precise, class-targeted fashion analysis, rather than returning noisy results across all fashion classes.",
    "llm_c": "Here is the detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow based on your request.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform targeted object detection on an image. The primary goal is to identify and locate a specific subset of fashion accessories—namely belts, scarves, and necklaces—while ignoring all other objects that may be present.\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Object Detection:** The system must first identify all detectable fashion items in the image.\n*   **Localization:** For each identified item, its position (e.g., a bounding box) must be determined.\n*   **Class Filtering:** The system must filter the detected objects to include *only* the classes specified by the user (\"belts\", \"scarves\", \"necklaces\").\n*   **Summarization:** The final output should be a clear, human-readable summary of the findings.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the initial input simultaneously triggers two parallel processing branches that later converge.\n\nThe user's request, containing both an image and a text query, is the initial stimulus. The image is routed to a specialized **Object Detection Module** that finds all possible fashion items. In parallel, the text query is routed to a simple **Keyword Extraction Module** to determine which specific accessories the user is interested in.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches—a raw list of all detected objects from the first, and a target list of desired classes from the second—act as inputs to a central **Synaptic Filter & Aggregator Module**. This module functions like a synapse, integrating the signals by matching the detected objects against the user's desired classes. It filters out any irrelevant items and consolidates the matching results.\n\nFinally, this aggregated information is formatted into a clean, summarized report for the user, indicating which of the requested accessories were found and where they are located.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification\n\n#### **Module 1: Object Detection**\n\n*   **Model Used:** `ObjDet-HuggingFace-valentinafeve-yolos-fashionpedia`\n*   **Justification:** This model is the only one provided that is suitable for the core task. Its name explicitly indicates it is an **Object Detection (`ObjDet`)** model based on the YOLOS architecture and fine-tuned on the **`Fashionpedia`** dataset. This makes it an expert at identifying and locating a wide variety of clothing and accessory items, which is precisely what is needed.\n    *   The `Classification-HuggingFace-microsoft-resnet-50` model is **not used** because it is an image classifier. It would output a single label for the entire image (e.g., \"person wearing sweater\") but cannot locate individual items like a belt or a necklace.\n    *   The `NST-fast-neural-style-rain-princess` model is **not used** as it is completely irrelevant. It performs artistic style transfer, a generative task, whereas the user requires an analytical one.\n*   **Input:** An image file (e.g., `user_image.jpg`).\n*   **Processing:** The model scans the image and identifies all objects it has been trained to recognize from the Fashionpedia dataset.\n*   **Intermediate Output (Raw Detections):** A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the object's class label and its bounding box coordinates.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```json\n        [\n          {\"box\": [210, 350, 450, 380], \"label\": \"belt\"},\n          {\"box\": [150, 180, 250, 220], \"label\": \"necklace\"},\n          {\"box\": [100, 50, 500, 280], \"label\": \"t-shirt\"}\n        ]\n        ```\n\n#### **Module 2: Keyword Extraction**\n\n*   **Model Used:** None. This is a simple rule-based or basic NLP parsing step.\n*   **Justification:** To create a truly synaptic and responsive system, the workflow must understand the user's specific intent. This module isolates the \"target\" classes from the natural language query, providing the crucial context needed for the filtering step.\n*   **Input:** The user's text query.\n    *   **Example:** `\"Please check this image for accessories such as belts, scarves, and necklaces.\"`\n*   **Processing:** Parses the string to find keywords corresponding to known accessory classes.\n*   **Intermediate Output (Target Classes):** A list of lowercase strings.\n    *   **Example:** `['belt', 'scarf', 'necklace']`\n\n#### **Module 3: Synaptic Filter & Aggregator**\n\n*   **Model Used:** None. This is a custom logic module that integrates the outputs from the previous two branches.\n*   **Justification:** This module is the heart of the CNAPS design. It acts as the synapse where the \"what was found\" signal (from Module 1) is modulated by the \"what was requested\" signal (from Module 2). This convergence allows the system to produce a precise, context-aware answer instead of just a raw data dump.\n*   **Input:**\n    1.  The `Raw Detections` list from Module 1.\n    2.  The `Target Classes` list from Module 2.\n*   **Processing:**\n    1.  Iterate through each dictionary in the `Raw Detections` list.\n    2.  For each detected object, check if its `\"label\"` exists in the `Target Classes` list.\n    3.  Create a new list containing only the objects that match.\n    4.  Count the occurrences of each requested item.\n*   **Final Output:** A user-friendly, formatted summary of the findings.\n    *   **Example:**\n        ```\n        Analysis Complete.\n\n        Here are the accessories I found from your list:\n        - Belts: 1\n        - Scarves: 0\n        - Necklaces: 1\n\n        (Optional: An image with bounding boxes drawn for the found items could also be generated here.)\n        ```"
