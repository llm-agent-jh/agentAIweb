    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a whiteboard photo by enlarging it 2x while making small, blurry letters clearly readable**. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Image super-resolution**: Upscaling the image by 2x factor\n- **Deblurring**: Removing blur to improve text legibility and overall clarity\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input whiteboard image flows through two parallel processing branches that address different aspects of image degradation. The **deblurring branch** focuses on sharpening blurry text and details, while the **super-resolution branch** handles the 2x enlargement requirement. These branches process the image simultaneously, then their outputs are intelligently merged to produce a final enhanced image that is both larger and clearer. The workflow includes a **quality assessment feedback loop** that can trigger re-processing if the text readability doesn't meet standards.\n\n### B.

Workflow Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design addresses the dual nature of the user's request by leveraging:\n\n1. **MSSNet-RealBlurR**: Specifically designed for real-world blur removal (as referenced in the POSTECH paper), making it ideal for actual meeting whiteboard photos that suffer from motion blur or focus issues.\n\n2. **IMDN-2x**: Provides efficient 2x super-resolution through information multi-distillation (as detailed in the ArXiv paper), ensuring the enlargement preserves important text details.\n\n3. **Parallel Processing**: The branching approach allows simultaneous deblurring and super-resolution, which is more effective than sequential processing that could compound artifacts.\n\n4. **Adaptive Fusion**: Combines the strengths of both branches while minimizing their individual weaknesses, ensuring optimal text readability in the final output.\n\nThe synaptic nature of this workflow mimics how human vision processes degraded images—simultaneously addressing multiple quality factors and integrating the results for optimal perception.",

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow designed to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to process a photograph of a whiteboard to improve the legibility of its text. The core goal is to produce a 2x larger image where the small and blurry letters are rendered sharp and clear.\n\nThis involves two primary sub-goals:\n*   **Super-Resolution:** To increase the image dimensions by a factor of 2, addressing the \"small letters.\"\n*   **Deblurring:** To remove motion or focus blur, addressing the \"blurry letters\" and ensuring the final text is sharp.\nA critical secondary goal is **Legibility Maximization**, meaning the final output must prioritize the clarity of characters over other aesthetic qualities.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system will process the input whiteboard photo through a synaptic, branching workflow that explores multiple enhancement strategies in parallel and intelligently selects the best outcome.\n\nThe input image first enters a **Pre-processing Synapse**. This module analyzes the image's lighting conditions. If it detects low-light characteristics (common in indoor meeting photos), it routes the image through the `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` model. Otherwise, it passes the image through unchanged.\n\nFrom the pre-processor, the image signal **bifurcates into two parallel processing branches** to determine the optimal order of operations for deblurring and super-resolution:\n*   **Path A (Deblur-First):** The image is first deblurred using `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` and then enlarged 2x using `SISR-IMDN-2x`. This path prioritizes cleaning up blur artifacts at the original resolution.\n*   **Path B (Enlarge-First):** The image is first enlarged 2x with `SISR-IMDN-2x` and then deblurred using `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`. This path provides the deblurring model with more pixels to work with, which can sometimes yield sharper details.\n\nThe outputs from both Path A and Path B are then sent to a **Quality Gate Synapse**. This final module acts as a selection arbiter. It uses an objective, task-specific metric—such as running an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model on both images—to determine which result has more legible text. The image that yields a higher character count or confidence score from the OCR is selected as the final, optimal output, ensuring the user's goal of \"all letters can be seen clearly\" is met.\n\n### B.

Justification for Design Choices\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because the optimal order of deblurring and super-resolution is not universal; it is highly dependent on the specific characteristics of the input image.\n\n1.  **Conditional Pre-processing:** Meeting room photos are often taken in suboptimal lighting. Using the **`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`** as a conditional first step prevents amplifying noise and darkness, which would degrade the performance of subsequent models. This conditional path is a core feature of a dynamic CNAPS workflow.\n\n2.  **Parallel Branching (Path A vs. Path B):**\n    *   The core of the synaptic design is the parallel execution of two distinct strategies. There is no single \"correct\" order for deblurring and super-resolution.\n    *   **Path A (Deblur-First)** is often effective because deblurring a smaller image with **`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`** is computationally efficient and can prevent the super-resolution model from hallucinating artifacts based on the blur pattern. The **`SISR-IMDN-2x`** then has a cleaner, though smaller, image to upscale.\n    *   **Path B (Enlarge-First)** can be superior if the original image contains fine details obscured by blur. Upscaling first with **`SISR-IMDN-2x`** provides more pixel data, which may allow the **`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`** to recover sharper edges and text features. The paper for `Deblur-MSSNet` (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) highlights its multi-scale architecture, which is well-suited to operate on the upscaled image data.\n\n3.  **Intelligent Selection (Quality Gate Synapse):**\n    *   A simple merge or blend of the two outputs would likely degrade quality. A CNAPS workflow requires an intelligent decision-making node.\n    *   The user's goal is legibility (\"seen clearly\"). Therefore, the selection metric must align with this goal. Using an OCR model as the arbiter is a perfect task-specific quality metric. It directly measures which of the two paths produced more machine-readable—and therefore likely human-readable—text.\n    *   This selection mechanism ensures the final output is not just a guess, but the demonstrably better result for the user's specific need, leveraging the strengths of all models in the network. The choice of **`SISR-IMDN-2x`** (Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11856v1) is justified by its specific 2x scaling factor, directly matching the user's request."
