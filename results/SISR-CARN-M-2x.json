    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **restore clarity to a blurry scanned document and enlarge it 2x while maintaining clear, readable text**. This involves two primary sub-goals:\n- **Deblurring**: Remove motion blur, focus blur, or scanning artifacts from the document\n- **Super-resolution upscaling**: Enlarge the image by 2x while preserving text sharpness and legibility\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **sequential-parallel hybrid network** where the input document first undergoes deblurring through multiple specialized MSSNet variants running in parallel. Each variant targets different blur types (real-world blur patterns from RealBlurJ, RealBlurR, and motion blur from GoPro dataset). The outputs are then intelligently fused based on confidence scores and blur type detection. The deblurred result feeds into a super-resolution module that enlarges the document 2x while maintaining text clarity. A final quality assessment module validates the output and can trigger re-processing if needed.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Blur Type Pre-Analysis**\n- Input: Raw scanned document (RGB image)\n- Output: Blur confidence scores for each variant\n- Function: Analyzes blur patterns to weight fusion later\n\n**Module 2: Parallel MSSNet Deblurring**\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurJ**: Handles real-world blur from Japanese dataset\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurR**: Processes realistic blur patterns  \n- **MSSNet-L-GoPro**: Addresses motion blur and camera shake\n- Input: Original blurry document\n- Output: Three deblurred versions with confidence maps\n\n**Module 3: Confidence-Based Fusion**\n- Input: Three deblurred outputs + confidence scores\n- Output: Single optimal deblurred document\n- Function: Pixel-wise weighted combination based on local blur analysis\n\n**Module 4: Text-Aware Super-Resolution**\n- Input: Deblurred document at original resolution\n- Output: 2x enlarged document with sharp text\n- Function: Preserves text edges while upscaling\n\n**Module 5: Quality Assessment**\n- Input: Final enhanced document\n- Output: Quality metrics + validation flag\n- Function: Ensures text readability and triggers re-processing if needed\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **Multi-Scale Structural Network (MSSNet)** architecture from the provided paper, which uses multi-scale feature extraction and structural preservation specifically designed for deblurring tasks. The parallel processing of different MSSNet variants is justified because:\n\n1. **RealBlurJ and RealBlurR variants** handle different real-world blur patterns commonly found in scanned documents\n2. **MSSNet-L-GoPro** addresses motion blur that may occur during scanning\n3. The **multi-scale approach** in MSSNet preserves fine text details while removing blur\n\nThe synaptic branching allows the system to **hedge against different blur types** simultaneously, then intelligently combine results rather than guessing which single model to use. This increases robustness for varied document scanning conditions.\n\n**Reference**: MSSNet paper (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) demonstrates superior performance on text-containing images through its structural preservation mechanisms, making it ideal for document restoration tasks.",

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an AI scientist and architect, I will design a robust CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a single, blurry scanned document. The primary goal is to improve text legibility by first removing the blur and then increasing the image resolution by a factor of two.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Clarity Restoration:** The system must effectively deblur the image, targeting artifacts common in scanned documents (e.g., focus blur, minor motion blur from the scanner).\n*   **Super-Resolution (2x):** The system must enlarge the image to twice its original dimensions while preserving or enhancing detail.\n*   **Text Legibility:** The ultimate measure of success is whether the text becomes clear and easy to read. This implies that the restoration process should not introduce artifacts that distort letterforms.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network. It begins by branching the input to two specialized deblurring modules. The outputs are then evaluated by a quality assessment module, which acts as a \"synaptic gate,\" allowing only the superior result to pass through for the final super-resolution step.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system takes the single blurry scanned document as input. Instead of assuming one deblurring model is best, the input signal **branches** and is sent in parallel to two different deblurring models: **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** and **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR**. These models are trained on different real-world blur datasets and may excel at different types of blur (e.g., one might handle focus blur better, the other might handle JPEG compression artifacts alongside blur).\n\nBoth deblurred outputs are then fed into the **Quality-IQA** module. This module acts as the critical decision-making synapse in our network. It assesses the perceptual quality of both deblurred images and assigns a score to each.\n\nA **conditional gate** then compares these two scores. The image with the higher quality score is selected as the \"winner\" and is passed on to the next stage. The other branch is terminated. This selection-and-merge step ensures we use the best possible deblurred version for the final enhancement.\n\nFinally, this single, high-quality deblurred image is processed by the **SwinIR** model, configured for 2x super-resolution. SwinIR enlarges the image, generating the final, clear, and twice-as-large document that is delivered to the user.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is explicitly designed based on the capabilities and limitations of the provided models.\n\n1.  **Input Analysis & Model Exclusion:**\n    *   The user's input is a \"scanned document,\" which is a single static image. Therefore, **TTVSR** (Learning Trajectory-Aware Transformer for *Video* Super-Resolution) is fundamentally unsuitable for this task and is excluded from the workflow.\n    *   The **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro** model, while a capable deblurrer, is trained on the GoPro dataset, which primarily features motion blur from hand-held cameras. The blur in a scanned document is more likely focus blur or linear scanner motion. The **RealBlur** datasets are more appropriate for this \"real-world\" document restoration task.\n\n2.  **Phase 1: Parallel Deblurring (The Branch):**\n    *   **Models:** **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ** and **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR**.\n    *   **Justification:** The `MSSNet.pdf` paper describes a Multi-Stage Self-Supervised Network for image deblurring. Since we do not know the exact nature of the blur on the user's document, we cannot be certain if the `RealBlurJ` or `RealBlurR` variant will perform better. By running both in parallel, we create a competitive evaluation. This branching approach is more robust than relying on a single model and is a core principle of a CNAPS architecture.\n\n3.  **Phase 2: Synaptic Quality Assessment (The Gate):**\n    *   **Model:** **Quality-IQA**.\n    *   **Justification:** This is the most critical component of the synaptic design. The `Quality-IQA.pdf` paper describes a Deep Image Quality Assessment method specifically designed to evaluate the output of restoration models like super-resolution and, by extension, deblurring. Instead of using a simple, potentially flawed metric like PSNR or SSIM, we use this specialized AI model to act as an expert judge. It analyzes the two deblurred outputs (`deblurred_J.png` and `deblurred_R.png`) and provides a perceptually-relevant quality score. The conditional gate then uses this score to intelligently **merge** the parallel branches, selecting only the superior candidate for the final step.\n\n4.  **Phase 3: Final Super-Resolution (The Output Path):**\n    *   **Model:** **SwinIR**.\n    *   **Justification:** The `SwinIR.pdf` paper presents a powerful image restoration model using Swin Transformers. It achieves state-of-the-art results in tasks including image super-resolution. It is the ideal choice for the user's requirement to \"enlarge it twice.\" By performing this step *after* the deblur"
