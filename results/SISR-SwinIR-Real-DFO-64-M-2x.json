Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a blurry nighttime street photograph by **deblurring and upscaling it by 2x** while ensuring clear visibility of street lights and people's outlines. \n\nSub-goals include:\n- **Motion/blur removal** to sharpen the image\n- **Low-light enhancement** to improve visibility in nighttime conditions\n- **2x super-resolution** to increase image resolution\n- **Structure preservation** for street lights and human silhouettes\n- **Noise reduction** typical in low-light photography\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input blurry night image flows through multiple specialized pathways that process different aspects simultaneously. The input branches into three parallel processing streams: **deblurring**, **low-light enhancement**, and **feature extraction**. The deblurring and enhancement streams process the image independently, then their outputs merge through a **feature fusion layer**. This merged result combines with the extracted structural features to preserve important details like street lights and human outlines. Finally, the fused enhanced image flows through a **2x super-resolution module** to achieve the desired upscaling while maintaining the restored clarity.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic architecture** is justified by the complementary nature of the available models:\n\n**MSSNet-RealBlurR** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) is specifically designed for real-world blur removal, making it ideal for the primary deblurring task. The paper demonstrates superior performance on realistic blur patterns compared to synthetic datasets.\n\n**Low-light enhancer** addresses the nighttime photography challenge by improving visibility without over-exposing street lights, which is crucial for the user's specific requirement.\n\n**MSSNet-L-GoPro** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf) provides the structural understanding needed to preserve important features like human outlines and street light definitions during the restoration process.\n\nThe **branching architecture** allows each model to specialize in its strength area while the **fusion mechanism** combines their outputs intelligently, avoiding the limitations of a simple linear pipeline where each step might degrade the previous step's improvements.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is simultaneously routed into two branches:\n\n- **Branch A (Deblur → Enhance):**  \n  Prioritizes structure by first applying `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` to correct blur and then `Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer` to improve lighting.\n\n- **Branch B (Enhance → Deblur):**  \n  Prioritizes detail visibility in dark zones by enhancing light first, then applying `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`.\n\nBoth branches produce intermediate images, which are passed into a **Fusion Module** that extracts structure from Branch A and luminance detail from Branch B. The fused image is then **upscaled using 2× interpolation** (e.g., Lanczos), due to the absence of a provided super-resolution model.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the CNAPS-style workflow for the user's request, using only the provided models.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore a single, blurry, low-light street photograph. The primary goal is to improve visual quality by simultaneously removing blur and enhancing brightness/clarity, followed by a 2x enlargement of the image.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Deblurring:** To remove motion or focus blur.\n*   **Low-Light Enhancement:** To improve visibility in dark areas and manage the high contrast of night scenes.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** To ensure that \"people's outlines\" become sharp and well-defined.\n*   **Clarity of Light Sources:** To render \"street lights\" clearly, avoiding excessive glow or halo artifacts.\n*   **Super-Resolution:** To increase the image dimensions by a factor of 2.\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\nThe core challenge is that deblurring and low-light enhancement are coupled problems. Deblurring a dark image first can amplify noise, while enhancing a blurry image first can distort the blur kernel, making it harder to remove. A CNAPS-style workflow is ideal here, as it allows us to explore both processing orders in parallel and fuse the results for a superior outcome.\n\n---\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system takes the single blurry, low-light photo as input. Instead of a simple linear pipeline, the input is immediately routed into two parallel \"synaptic\" branches.\n\n*   **Branch A (Structure-First Path):** This branch prioritizes structural integrity. It first sends the image to the **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** model to create a sharp, but likely still dark and noisy, version. This result is then passed to the **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer** to correct the brightness and contrast. The output of this branch will excel at defining sharp edges and outlines.\n\n*   **Branch B (Detail-First Path):** This branch prioritizes recovering detail from shadows. It first sends the image to the **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**. This brightens the image, providing more information for the subsequent deblurring step. The enhanced image is then passed to the **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** model. The output of this branch will likely have better color, less amplified noise in the shadows, but potentially softer edges.\n\n*   **Fusion Synapse:** The intermediate results from both Branch A and Branch B are fed into a **Fusion Module**. This module's job is to intelligently combine the two versions. It uses the sharp structures from Branch A's output as a guide to sharpen the cleaner, more detailed output of Branch B. This creates a final, restored image at the original resolution that contains the best attributes of both paths: sharp outlines, well-exposed details, and controlled noise.\n\n*   **Final Output:** The fused, restored image is produced. **Crucially, the provided AI models do not include a super-resolution function.** Therefore, the 2x upscaling must be handled as a final, separate step. A traditional high-quality algorithm like Lanczos resampling is recommended, with a note that a dedicated AI super-resolution model would be required for a fully AI-based workflow.\n\n---\n\n### B.

Justification of Design Choices\n\n1.  **Model Selection:**\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** ([Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)): This model is chosen over `Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro`. The user's input is a \"street photo,\" which implies complex, real-world blur from camera shake, object motion, and low light conditions. The `RealBlurR` dataset, on which this model was trained, is specifically designed to capture such realistic degradations. The `GoPro` dataset is excellent but focuses more on motion blur from fast-moving cameras, making `RealBlurR` the more robust choice for this general-purpose task.\n    *   **Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer**: This is the only model provided for the explicit purpose of handling the \"night\" aspect of the photo. Its role is critical for revealing details that the deblurring model can then act upon.\n\n2.  **CNAPS Branching Rationale:**\n    *   A simple linear pipeline (e.g., Deblur -> Enhance) is brittle. It risks creating severe noise artifacts.\n    *   The proposed parallel, synaptic structure is a hallmark of advanced image processing. It acknowledges that there is no single \"correct\" order of operations. By running both sequences (`Deblur -> Enhance` and `Enhance -> Deblur`) simultaneously, the system gathers more information about the optimal restoration.\n    *   This branching design directly addresses the user's combined requests for \"clear"
