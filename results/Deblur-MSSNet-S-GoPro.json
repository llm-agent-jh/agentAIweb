    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore sharp, clear details in blurry food photographs caused by camera shake (motion blur). The primary goal is **motion deblurring** with sub-goals including:\n- Structure preservation of food items and restaurant setting\n- Texture realism enhancement for food surfaces\n- Detail recovery while maintaining natural appearance\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes shaky food photos through a **dual-pathway synaptic network** that branches into specialized deblurring modules, then merges results for optimal restoration. Input photos first flow to a **motion blur assessment stage** that determines blur severity and characteristics. The system then branches into **two parallel deblurring pathways**: one optimized for real-world blur scenarios (MSSNet-RealBlurR) and another for severe motion blur (MSSNet-L-GoPro). Both pathways process the image simultaneously, generating intermediate deblurred candidates. These results merge at a **quality-aware fusion stage** that selects the best regions from each pathway. Finally, the merged result flows to a **detail enhancement module** (SwinIR) that refines textures and recovers fine food details, producing the final restored image.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: MSSNet-RealBlurR Branch**\n- **Input**: RGB image tensor (H×W×3)\n- **Processing**: Real-world blur kernel estimation and restoration\n- **Output**: Deblurred image with preserved food textures\n- **Reference**: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 2: MSSNet-L-GoPro Branch** \n- **Input**: Same RGB image tensor\n- **Processing**: Severe motion blur handling with large kernel support\n- **Output**: Deblurred image optimized for strong motion artifacts\n- **Reference**: https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Module 3: Quality Fusion**\n- **Input**: Two deblurred candidates from parallel branches\n- **Processing**: Pixel-wise quality assessment and optimal region selection\n- **Output**: Merged deblurred image combining best aspects of both results\n\n**Module 4: SwinIR Enhancement**\n- **Input**: Merged deblurred image\n- **Processing**: Transformer-based detail restoration and texture enhancement\n- **Output**: Final high-quality food photo with restored fine details\n- **Reference**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10257\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis **synaptic branching design** leverages the complementary strengths of different deblurring approaches. The **MSSNet dual-pathway strategy** is justified because real-world camera shake exhibits varying blur characteristics - the RealBlurR variant handles typical handheld camera motion while the L-GoPro variant addresses more severe shake scenarios. The **quality fusion stage** ensures optimal results by combining the best-performing regions from each pathway, mimicking how biological synapses integrate multiple signal sources. Finally, **SwinIR's transformer architecture** provides superior texture restoration for food imagery, as demonstrated in the paper's results on natural image enhancement tasks. This workflow maximizes restoration quality while maintaining computational efficiency through parallel processing.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to restore clarity and sharpness in food photographs blurred by camera shake.  \nSub-goals include:\n- Motion deblurring\n- Preservation of food item structure and arrangement\n- Restoration of texture realism (e.g., gloss, crumbs)\n- Suppression of deblurring artifacts (e.g., ringing, blockiness)\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis system restores blurry food photos using a **parallel-pathway synaptic architecture**. The input photo is first sent simultaneously to two deblurring models—**Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** and **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro**—that handle typical and severe motion blur respectively. Their outputs are analyzed and the higher-quality result is selected via a **Quality Gate**. Then, a conditional check assesses if the image contains amplified JPEG artifacts. If so, the image is passed to **Restoration-SwinIR-Jpeg30** for cleanup. If not, it is returned directly. The result is a clean, sharp, and artifact-free food photo.\n\n---\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed design for a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform non-blind image deblurring on a photograph of food that suffers from motion blur due to camera shake. The goal is to restore the sharpness and fine details of the food, making the image clear and visually appealing.\n\n**Sub-goals involved:**\n*   **Blur Removal:** Eliminate the motion blur caused by a shaky hand.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Restore the intricate textures of the food (e.g., searing marks, sauce gloss, crumb structure) without making it look artificial.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Maintain the original shapes and arrangement of the food on the plate.\n*   **Artifact Suppression:** Avoid introducing new visual artifacts like ringing or blotches during the restoration process.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input in parallel and uses a conditional path for refinement, ensuring the best possible result by leveraging the specific strengths of each model.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's shaky food photograph as its initial input. Instead of a single processing path, the input signal **branches** and is sent to two specialized deblurring models simultaneously: **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** and **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro**. These models run in parallel, each producing a deblurred version of the image based on its unique training data.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches then **merge** at a \"Quality Gate.\" This conceptual module analyzes both deblurred images to select the one with superior quality (e.g., better sharpness, fewer artifacts). This selection is crucial because one model may outperform the other depending on the specific nature of the camera shake.\n\nFinally, the single, best-deblurred image enters a **conditional path**. A detection module checks this image for significant JPEG compression artifacts, which can be exacerbated by the deblurring process. If artifacts are detected, the image is routed to the **Restoration-SwinIR-Jpeg30** model for a final cleaning step. If no significant artifacts are found, this step is bypassed. The final, restored image is then delivered to the user.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style workflow is superior to a simple linear pipeline because it intelligently leverages the specialized capabilities of each model.\n\n1.  **Parallel Deblurring Branch (Module 1):** The user's problem is \"shaking,\" which is a form of real-world motion blur.\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR** ([Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) is the primary candidate. It is trained on the RealBlurR dataset, which specifically contains images with blur captured from real-world camera shake. This makes it exceptionally well-suited to the user's problem description.\n    *   **Deblur-MSSNet-L-GoPro** ([Paper](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) is included in a parallel branch because the GoPro dataset, while different, also contains complex motion blur. In some cases (e.g., a quick, sharp shake), its training might yield a better result.\n    *   **Justification:** By running both and selecting the best output at the **Quality Gate**, the system becomes more robust and is not locked into a single assumption about the nature of the blur. This mimics a biological synapse strengthening the most effective pathway.\n\n2.  **Conditional Refinement Path (Module 2):** A deblurring process can often amplify underlying, low-visibility artifacts present in the original compressed image.\n    *   **Restoration-SwinIR-Jpeg30** ([Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10257)) is a state-of-the-art model specifically designed for removing JPEG compression artifacts. It is *not* a deblurring model.\n    *   **Justification:** Using this model unconditionally would be inefficient and could potentially soften an image that doesn't need it. The **conditional path** ensures it is only activated when the \"Artifact Check\" detects a problem (e.g., blockiness). This targeted application of a specialized tool is a"
