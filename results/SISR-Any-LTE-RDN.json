    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to upscale a poster image by 3.5x while preserving both facial details/expressions and text clarity. This is a specialized super-resolution task requiring dual-focus enhancement: **human face preservation** and **text legibility enhancement**.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Structure preservation (overall poster layout)\n- Facial expression detail enhancement\n- Text clarity and readability improvement\n- Texture realism maintenance\n- Consistent quality across different content types\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system implements a **dual-pathway enhancement network** that branches the input image into specialized processing streams. The input poster flows through a content analysis stage that identifies facial regions and text areas. This triggers two parallel enhancement branches: a **face-specialized pathway** using pose estimation for structural guidance, and a **text-specialized pathway** for character clarity. These enhanced components are then intelligently merged with a general super-resolution backbone, creating a synapse-like convergence that produces the final 3.5x enlarged image with optimized quality for both human features and textual content.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Breakdown\n\n**Module 1: Content Analysis & Region Detection**\n- **Input:** Original poster image\n- **Process:** Segment image into face regions, text regions, and background\n- **Output:** Region masks + coordinate mappings\n- **Example:** `{face_regions: [(x1,y1,w1,h1)], text_regions: [(x2,y2,w2,h2)], background_mask: binary_array}`\n\n**Module 2: PoseEstimation-OpenPose Branch**\n- **Input:** Extracted face regions\n- **Process:** Generate pose keypoints for facial structure guidance\n- **Output:** Pose keypoints + facial landmark coordinates\n- **Example:** `{keypoints: [[x,y,confidence], ...], facial_landmarks: {nose: [x,y], eyes: [[x1,y1],[x2,y2]]}}`\n\n**Module 3: Pose-Guided Face Enhancement**\n- **Input:** Face regions + pose keypoints\n- **Process:** Structure-aware upscaling preserving facial expressions\n- **Output:** Enhanced face regions at 3.5x resolution\n- **Example:** High-resolution face patches with preserved expression details\n\n**Module 4: Text Enhancement Pipeline**\n- **Input:** Text region masks\n- **Process:** Character-aware super-resolution with edge preservation\n- **Output:** Crisp text regions at 3.5x resolution\n- **Example:** Sharp, readable text with clean character boundaries\n\n**Module 5: Intelligent Region Merger**\n- **Input:** Enhanced face regions + enhanced text regions + original background\n- **Process:** Seamless blending using coordinate mappings\n- **Output:** Composite image with enhanced regions integrated\n- **Example:** Unified poster with enhanced faces and text in original layout\n\n**Module 6: Global Super-Resolution Refinement**\n- **Input:** Composite image from merger\n- **Process:** Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-henmixReal for final quality enhancement\n- **Output:** Final 3.5x enlarged poster with consistent quality\n- **Example:** Professional-quality enlarged poster with natural textures\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\n**PoseEstimation-OpenPose Selection:** The OpenPose paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08008) demonstrates robust facial keypoint detection essential for maintaining facial structure during upscaling. This ensures expression preservation by providing geometric constraints for the enhancement process.\n\n**Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-henmixReal Integration:** While primarily a text-to-image model, henmixReal's realistic rendering capabilities make it suitable for final refinement and texture enhancement of the composite image, ensuring natural-looking results across the entire poster.\n\n**Synaptic Architecture Benefits:** The branching design allows specialized processing for different content types while maintaining global coherence through the merger stage. This mimics biological neural networks where different pathways process specific features before integration, resulting in superior quality compared to uniform upscaling approaches.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe input poster image is processed through two parallel branches. One branch uses `PoseEstimation-OpenPose` to detect human keypoints and guide a localized face enhancement step.

Justification\n\n- **PoseEstimation-OpenPose** is used for precise facial keypoint extraction, allowing guided enhancement of the face without distorting expressions【457†source】.\n- **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-CyberRealistic** is leveraged for its high-fidelity generative capacity to enhance text, texture, and general realism across the poster while preserving its layout and semantics.\n- The **Fusion Module** ensures that improvements from both pathways are harmonized, reflecting the CNAPS principle of modular specialization followed by synaptic integration.\n\nThis branching design ensures that each critical content type (faces and text) is enhanced using dedicated modules, then merged to produce a sharp, expressive, and legible 3.5x final poster.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the optimal CNAPS-style workflow to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform super-resolution on a poster image, enlarging it to 3.5 times its original size.\n\nThis involves two critical sub-goals:\n*   **Face Fidelity:** The facial features and expression of the person must be restored with high quality and realism.\n*   **Text Legibility:** All text on the poster must be sharp, clear, and readable in the final enlarged image.\n*   **Structural Cohesion:** The overall composition and structure of the poster must be preserved without introducing artifacts.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis task is a perfect candidate for a CNAPS workflow because the image contains distinct elements (a human face, text, background) that benefit from different, specialized processing paths before being recombined. A single, monolithic model would likely compromise on either face or text quality.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe workflow begins by taking the low-resolution poster image as input. The system immediately branches into two parallel processing streams.\n\n*   **Branch 1 (Holistic Enhancement):** The entire image is fed into a general-purpose super-resolution model, **Real-ESRGAN**. This model is excellent at upscaling diverse content, including backgrounds and text, preserving the overall structure and improving sharpness. This forms the foundational layer of our final image.\n*   **Branch 2 (Specialized Face Restoration):** In parallel, the system first uses an object detection model, **YOLOv7**, to identify the precise location (bounding box) of the person's face. This cropped face region is then sent to **CodeFormer**, a specialized face restoration model designed to reconstruct facial details with exceptional fidelity, correcting degradation and preserving the original expression.\n\nFinally, the outputs from these two branches are merged. The high-quality, restored face from the CodeFormer branch is intelligently composited back onto the holistically upscaled image from the Real-ESRGAN branch. This ensures that we leverage the strengths of both models: Real-ESRGAN for the text and background, and CodeFormer for the photorealistic face. The result is a single, coherent, high-resolution image that meets all the user's quality criteria.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly tailored to the user's request and is justified by the capabilities of the selected models as described in their papers.\n\n*   **Branching Logic:** The core of this design is the \"divide and conquer\" strategy. A poster contains mixed media. A single model might excel at photographic elements but struggle with sharp graphic text, or vice-versa.\n    *   **The Real-ESRGAN Branch** is chosen as the main path because the **Real-ESRGAN paper** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.10833)) highlights its strength in handling complex, real-world images with various types of degradation. It is highly effective at enhancing textures and sharpening elements like text, making it ideal for the non-face parts of the poster.\n    *   **The CodeFormer Branch** is a specialized synapse created to address the user's specific constraint: \"make sure that the person's expression... [is] clear.\" The **CodeFormer paper** ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11253)) describes it as a \"robust face restoration algorithm\" that excels at \"recovering faithful facial details\" even from severely degraded inputs. By isolating the face and processing it with Code"
