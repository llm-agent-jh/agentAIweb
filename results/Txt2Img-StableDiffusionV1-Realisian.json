    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\nThe user wants to retouch a staff profile photo by applying warm color tones and soft lighting effects to enhance emotional expression and visual appeal. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Preserve facial structure and professional appearance\n- Apply warm color grading/tone mapping\n- Enhance lighting conditions for softer, more flattering illumination\n- Maintain photo realism while improving overall aesthetic quality\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a synapse-like network where the input staff photo branches into two parallel enhancement pathways. The first pathway uses the low-light enhancer to improve lighting conditions and create softer illumination. The second pathway leverages Stable Diffusion models to generate warm-toned reference variations. These enhanced outputs then merge through a conditional blending process that combines the improved lighting with warm color characteristics, producing a professionally retouched photo that maintains structural integrity while achieving the desired emotional warmth.\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "Excellent. As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to stylistically retouch a staff profile photo to create a more inviting and professional look. The goal is to apply an aesthetic of \"warm tones\" and \"soft lighting\" to better convey positive emotion while ensuring the subject remains perfectly recognizable.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Identity Preservation:** The subject's face and key features must be preserved with high fidelity.\n*   **Structural Fidelity:** The original pose, composition, and clothing must be maintained.\n*   **Style Transfer:** The specific aesthetic of warm tones and soft lighting must be successfully applied.\n*   **Photorealism:** The final output must look like a real, high-quality photograph, not an illustration.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input image through parallel, complementary paths and then integrates the results for a final, optimal output.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's staff profile photo as its primary input. First, it performs a conditional pre-processing check: if the image is poorly lit, it is enhanced by the **`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`** model to create a high-quality base image.\n\nFrom this base, the workflow branches into two parallel synaptic pathways, each designed to achieve the user's goal with a different priority:\n\n1.  **Branch A (SDEdit Path):** This path prioritizes a holistic style transfer. It uses the **`SDEdit`** method to add a controlled amount of noise to the base image and then denoises it using the **`Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-henmixReal`** model, guided by a text prompt describing the desired warm, soft aesthetic. This approach is excellent for applying a new mood and color palette to the entire image.\n\n2.  **Branch B (ControlNet Path):** This path prioritizes absolute structural and identity preservation. It first generates a Canny edge map from the base image. This edge map acts as a rigid structural guide for the **`ControlNet`** model, which then generates a new image using **`henmixReal`** and the same text prompt. This ensures the pose, facial structure, and details are locked in place while the style is rendered around them.\n\nFinally, the outputs from both branches arrive at a **Synaptic Junction**. Here, both retouched candidates are presented for selection. This allows the system (or the user) to choose the image that best balances stylistic goals with identity preservation, delivering a superior final result.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification and References**\n\nThis CNAPS design is explicitly tailored to the user's request by leveraging the unique strengths of the provided models and papers.\n\n1.  **Conditional Pre-processing (`Enhancement-low-light-img-enhancer`):** Diffusion models perform best on well-lit, clear source images. If the input staff photo is underexposed, using this enhancer as a conditional first step is critical for maximizing the quality of the final output from both downstream branches.\n\n2.  **Parallel Branching for Robustness:** A simple linear pipeline is fragile. For instance, `SDEdit` might subtly alter facial features, while `ControlNet` might produce a \"colored-in\" look if not prompted carefully. By creating two parallel paths, the system generates options with different trade-offs, increasing the probability of a successful outcome.\n    *   **Branch A Justification (`SDEdit`):** The **`SDEdit`** paper ([arXiv:2108.01073](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01073)) is ideal for this task because it allows for realistic image editing by guiding a diffusion model. It strikes a balance between adhering to the source image and applying a new style from the prompt. This path is perfect for achieving the desired \"warm tones and soft lighting\" across the entire image composition.\n    *   **Branch B Justification (`ControlNet`):** For a staff profile, identity is non-negotiable. The **`ControlNet`** paper ([arXiv:2302.05543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543)) provides the perfect tool for this. It allows a text-to-image diffusion model to be conditioned on spatial inputs like edge maps. By using a Canny edge map, we provide the model with a precise, non-negotiable blueprint of the person's pose, facial structure, and outline. This path prioritizes structural fidelity above all else, ensuring the person is perfectly recognizable.\n\n3.  **Model Selection (`henmixReal`):** The user requires a retouch of a real person's photo. **`Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-henmixReal`** is the logical choice over `LemonTeaMix`, as its name implies a focus on photorealism, which is essential for a"
