Core Task\nThe user wants to apply artistic blur effects to wedding photos for aesthetic enhancement, creating a dreamy, romantic atmosphere while maintaining the subjects' clarity and overall photo quality. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Selective blur application (background/foreground separation)\n- Preservation of important facial features and details\n- Maintaining natural lighting and color balance\n- Creating artistic depth-of-field effects\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input wedding photo flows through multiple parallel processing branches that analyze different aspects of the image. The workflow branches into three main pathways: blur quality assessment, multi-scale blur processing, and fine-detail preservation. These branches process the image simultaneously, then merge their outputs through a weighted combination system that intelligently blends results based on image regions and content analysis.\n\nThe **Deblur-MSSNet models** are repurposed in reverse - instead of removing blur, we use their understanding of blur patterns to selectively apply artistic blur effects. The **MIMO-UNet** provides multi-scale processing capabilities for handling different blur intensities across image regions.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Branch A - MSSNet-RealBlurR Module:**\n- **Input:** Original wedding photo (RGB, 1024x1024)\n- **Process:** Multi-scale blur pattern generation using reverse-engineered MSSNet\n- **Output:** Coarse blur map with artistic bokeh effects\n- **Reference:** https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Branch B - MIMO-UNet Module:**\n- **Input:** Original photo + content mask\n- **Process:** Region-aware blur application with multiple input/output handling\n- **Output:** Selectively blurred image preserving subject focus\n- **Reference:** https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf\n\n**Branch C - MSSNet-RealBlurJ Module:**\n- **Input:** Original photo + attention maps from Branches A & B\n- **Process:** Fine-detail preservation and blur refinement\n- **Output:** Detail-preserved blur with natural transitions\n- **Reference:** https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf\n\n**Adaptive Fusion Module:**\n- **Input:** Three processed images + confidence maps\n- **Process:** Weighted combination based on image content and user preferences\n- **Output:** Final artistically blurred wedding photo\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **multi-scale understanding** from MSSNet papers to create controlled artistic blur rather than remove it. The **MIMO-UNet's coarse-to-fine approach** (Cho et al., ICCV 2021) is ideal for handling different blur intensities across image regions, essential for wedding photos where subjects should remain sharp while backgrounds become dreamy.\n\nThe **synaptic branching** allows each model to contribute its strengths: MSSNet-RealBlurR for natural blur patterns, MIMO-UNet for region-aware processing, and MSSNet-RealBlurJ for fine-detail preservation. This parallel processing approach ensures the final result maintains photographic quality while achieving the desired artistic effect.",

Core Task\n\nThe user wants to artistically retouch wedding photos by adding a soft, blurred feeling that enhances the romantic atmosphere while preserving the facial clarity and structural integrity of the subjects.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- Apply realistic, optical-style blur (e.g., depth-of-field, bokeh)\n- Preserve faces and important subject details\n- Maintain color balance and lighting realism\n- Ensure the blur feels intentional, not artificial\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nInstead of naïvely applying a digital blur, this system inverts the problem by generating a blur pattern that expert deblurring models (trained on real-world blur) would accept as “realistic.” The image flows through a saliency-guided generator that creates an initial blur kernel. This blurred version of the image is then evaluated by two deblurring networks—`MSSNet-RealBlurR` and `MIMO-UNet-RealBlur`—to measure how accurately they can reconstruct the original.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture inverts the blur task using deblurring networks as evaluators of realism:\n\n- **Why MSSNet and MIMO-UNet as validators?**  \n  These networks were trained to undo real-world blur patterns. If a blur applied to a photo can be reversed by them, it likely mimics realistic optics【203†source】.\n\n- **Why saliency-guided blur?**  \n  It protects core subjects (e.g., the couple) while softly defocusing the environment, achieving the dreamy effect the user wants.\n\n- **Why feedback optimization?**  \n  It ensures the generated blur is aesthetically pleasing and consistent with natural photographic depth-of-field or motion blur, fulfilling the artistic intention of the user.\n\nThis synaptic workflow simulates human photographic intent by blending saliency-driven awareness with expert-informed realism, producing retouched wedding photos that feel emotionally and visually authentic.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using the provided models.\n\nThe user's request to *add* a blur using models designed to *remove* blur presents a fascinating inverse problem. A simple pipeline is insufficient; we need a dynamic, goal-seeking system, which is precisely what a CNAPS architecture is designed for.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to apply a realistic and aesthetically pleasing blur effect to their wedding photos.\n\nThis involves the following sub-goals:\n*   **Blur Realism:** The blur should not be a simple digital filter (e.g., Gaussian blur). It should mimic real-world optical effects like motion blur or bokeh, as learned by the provided models from the RealBlur datasets.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The main subjects (e.g., the couple) should be treated with care. The system should allow for either keeping them sharp while blurring the background or applying a cohesive, natural motion blur across the entire scene.\n*   **Style Matching:** The \"blurred feeling\" must be consistent with the types of blur these advanced deblurring models are trained to reverse, ensuring a high-fidelity, plausible result.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow re-frames the task from \"applying a blur\" to \"finding a blur that a deblurring expert would recognize as realistic.\" We will use the deblurring models not as image processors in a pipeline, but as **discriminators** or **loss functions** within a generative optimization loop.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a sharp wedding photo as input. Instead of directly applying a pre-defined blur, it initiates a generative process to create a custom blur kernel.\n\nThe workflow branches into two main synaptic pathways:\n\n1.  **Guidance Path:** A preliminary analysis module (e.g., a saliency detector) identifies the key subjects in the photo, creating a guidance map. This allows the final blur to be applied contextually—for example, blurring the background more than the couple.\n2.  **Generative/Validation Loop:** This is the core of the CNAPS.\n    *   It begins by generating a candidate blur effect (represented by a blur kernel).\n    *   This blur is applied to the original sharp photo to create a blurred version.\n    *   In a key branching step, this blurred photo is sent **in parallel** to two different deblurring models: `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur` and `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`.\n    *   The outputs from these models are then merged at a \"synaptic junction\" where they are compared against the original sharp photo. The difference (or \"error\") tells us how \"realistic\" our generated blur was. If the deblurring models can easily reverse the blur, it means our generated blur is of a type they were trained on (i.e., realistic).\n    *   This error is used as a feedback signal to iteratively refine the blur kernel until the deblurring models can almost perfectly reconstruct the original image.\n\nFinally, the optimized, realistic blur kernel is applied to the original photo (guided by the saliency map) to produce the final, beautifully retouched image.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS design is dictated by the nature of the user's request and the specific tools provided.\n\n1.  **Inverse Problem Solution:** The user wants to *add blur*, but we only have *deblurring* models. A simple linear pipeline is impossible. The proposed generative loop is an elegant solution to this inverse problem. It leverages the deblurring models as expert judges of what constitutes a realistic blur, directly addressing the core task.\n\n2.  **Synaptic Branching for Robustness:** The workflow intentionally forks the validation process to both `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur` and `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`. This is a critical design choice for two reasons:\n    *   **Different Architectures:** The MIMO-UNet paper ([https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)) and the MSSNet paper ([https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf](https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf)) describe fundamentally different network structures. MIMO-UNet uses a multi-input/multi-output U-Net, while MSSNet uses a multi-stage, scale-space approach.\n    *   **Ensemble Effect:** By requiring the generated blur to be \"solvable\" by two architecturally distinct models, we create a more robust and generalized blur effect. This prevents \"overfitting\" our blur to the biases of a single model and ensures the final result is broadly perceived as realistic, fulfilling the **Blur Realism** sub-goal.\n\n3.  **Fulfilling Implicit User Needs:** The user's request for a \"blurred feeling\" is subjective. This workflow translates that subjective goal into a concrete, measurable objective: *minimize the reconstruction error from a committee of expert deblurring models*. The models were trained on the RealBlur datasets, which contain complex, non-uniform blurs from real cameras. By optimizing against these models, we ensure the generated blur has the same characteristics, achieving a high-quality, professional result that matches the implicit **Style Matching** and **Realism** sub-goals. The optional saliency branch provides the artistic control needed for **Structure Preservation** in a sensitive context like wedding photography."
