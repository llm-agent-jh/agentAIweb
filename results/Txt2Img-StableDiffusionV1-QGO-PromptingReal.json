CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a synapse-like network where the input store exterior photo branches into multiple parallel processing paths. First, the image is analyzed for blur and quality issues, then splits into two main branches: a deblurring pathway and a texture enhancement pathway. The deblurring branch uses specialized models to restore sharpness, while the texture enhancement branch leverages text-to-image diffusion models to add realistic textures guided by the original image structure. These processed outputs then merge through a fusion mechanism that combines the best qualities of both paths, ensuring the final result maintains structural integrity while achieving enhanced realism in textures, lighting, and overall visual quality.\n\n### B.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the core task and a CNAPS-style workflow designed to meet the user's request, using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to perform a high-fidelity, photorealistic enhancement of an existing store exterior photograph. The goal is not to create a new image from scratch, but to improve the input image by increasing its clarity and adding realistic, detailed textures to specific elements like walls, signage, and lighting, while preserving the original composition and structure.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n\n*   **Clarity Enhancement:** The input photo may be slightly blurry or soft; it needs to be sharpened first.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The original architecture, perspective, and layout of the store must be maintained.\n*   **Texture Realism:** New or enhanced textures must be photorealistic and seamlessly integrated.\n*   **Targeted Enhancement:** The system must be able to modify specific elements (walls, signs) without negatively affecting the rest of the image.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis synaptic workflow operates on a principle of **Foundation and Refinement**. The system takes a single store exterior photo as input and immediately routes it down two parallel preparatory paths.\n\nThe first and most critical path focuses on creating a high-quality **foundation**. The input image is sent to the `Deblur-MIMO-UNet` model to remove any motion or focus blur, producing a sharp, clear \"base canvas.\" This is crucial because generating high-quality textures requires a sharp source.\n\nSimultaneously, the original image and user-provided text prompts (e.g., \"detailed brick wall,\" \"glowing neon sign\") and optional masks are prepared.\n\nOnce the deblurred base canvas is ready, it acts as the input for a new set of branching operations powered by the `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic` model (used in an image-to-image capacity). One branch performs a subtle, **global enhancement** across the entire image to improve overall lighting and texture cohesiveness. A parallel branch performs targeted **inpainting** on specific, user-masked areas (like a wall or a sign) to replace or dramatically enhance their textures with high-fidelity details generated from specific prompts.\n\nFinally, in a **synaptic merge**, the results are composited. The globally enhanced image serves as the new background, and the highly-detailed, inpainted sections are seamlessly layered on top. This produces a final, retouched photograph that is both sharp and features lifelike, realistic textures in the desired areas.\n\n### B.

Justification of Design\n\nThis CNAPS workflow is specifically architected to leverage the strengths of the provided models to achieve the user's goal.\n\n1.  **Initial Deblurring as Foundation (Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur):**\n    *   **Justification:** The user wants to \"bring photos to life.\" Real-world photos, especially amateur ones, often suffer from minor blur. Starting with a deblurring step is essential for creating a high-quality base. The `Txt2Img-StableDiffusion` model will produce far superior and more detailed textures when its input image (`img2img` or `inpainting`) is sharp and clear.\n    *   **Model Choice:** We use **`Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur`**. The associated paper, \"[Rethinking Coarse-To-Fine Approach in Single Image Deblurring](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf),\" describes a Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) system that processes the image at multiple scales simultaneously. This is highly effective for complex, real-world blur and is perfect for creating a robust \"base canvas.\" While `MSSNet` is also a deblurring model, MIMO-UNet's coarse-to"

The justification is outstanding, explaining not just which models to use, but *how* to configure them (e.g., denoising strength) for different purposes. The use of a `mermaid` diagram is also a major plus for clarity."
