    "llm_a": "# CNAPS-Style Multi-Module Workflow for Video Conference Background Replacement\n\n## 1. Core Task\nThe user wants to replace the background in a video conference screenshot with a library-themed background while preserving the foreground person and maintaining visual coherence. \n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Accurate foreground/background segmentation\n- Semantic understanding of desired library aesthetic\n- Natural integration of person into new background\n- Preservation of lighting and perspective consistency\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\nThe system operates as a **synapse-like branching network** where the input screenshot flows through multiple parallel processing paths that eventually converge. The input branches into three specialized modules: one generates descriptive captions of the current scene, another performs visual question-answering to understand spatial relationships, and a third handles the actual background replacement with textual guidance. These modules communicate bidirectionally—the captioning and VQA modules inform the background replacement module about foreground details, lighting conditions, and spatial constraints, while the replacement module can query back for specific details. The outputs merge to produce a final image with the person seamlessly integrated into a library background.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module A - Image Captioning (BLIP)**\n- **Input:** Raw video conference screenshot\n- **Process:** Generate detailed scene description\n- **Output:** Text description (e.g., \"A person sitting at a desk in an office with a window and bookshelf visible in the background\")\n- **Purpose:** Provides semantic understanding of current scene elements\n\n**Module B - Visual Q&A Analysis (ViLT)**\n- **Input:** Screenshot + specific questions about spatial relationships\n- **Process:** Answer targeted questions about person positioning, lighting, scale\n- **Sample Questions:** \"Where is the person positioned in the frame?\", \"What is the lighting direction?\", \"What objects are in the foreground?\"\n- **Output:** Structured answers informing background replacement constraints\n\n**Module C - Instruction Following (InstructCV)**\n- **Input:** Original image + integrated textual instruction from Modules A & B\n- **Process:** Execute background replacement guided by semantic understanding\n- **Instruction Example:** \"Replace the office background with a library setting, keeping the person in the center, maintaining current lighting direction, and ensuring the person appears to be sitting at a library desk\"\n- **Output:** Final image with library background\n\n**Synapse Merger Logic:**\nThe merger combines outputs by:\n1. Using Module A's caption to understand scene composition\n2. Using Module B's spatial analysis to maintain realistic positioning\n3. Feeding both as contextual instructions to Module C for precise background replacement\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis design leverages the **complementary strengths** of each model:\n\n- **BLIP (arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086)** provides robust image-to-text captioning, giving semantic understanding of the scene composition necessary for maintaining foreground-background relationships.\n\n- **ViLT (arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03334)** offers sophisticated visual reasoning capabilities, allowing the system to understand spatial relationships and answer specific questions about person positioning and environmental context.\n\n- **InstructCV (arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00390)** specializes in following complex visual instructions, making it ideal for the final background replacement step when guided by the semantic understanding from the other modules.\n\nThe **synapse-like architecture** is essential because background replacement requires multiple types of understanding that no single model provides: semantic scene understanding, spatial reasoning, and instruction-following capabilities. The branching allows parallel processing of different aspects, while the merging ensures all information is integrated for optimal results.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to change the background of a video conference screenshot to a library while preserving the subject in the foreground. The output should appear natural, with lighting, positioning, and semantic context maintained.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Foreground/background separation\n- Natural integration into a new library background\n- Visual coherence (e.g., lighting consistency, edge blending)\n- Semantic alignment with “library” environment\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe user’s image and instruction are routed into three specialized branches:\n- One extracts descriptive information about the original image (BLIP).\n- One analyzes visual relationships to support placement and semantic understanding (ViLT).\n- One performs the background replacement using multi-modal instructions (InstructCV).\n\nThese branches converge in a synaptic merge phase where semantic and spatial context from BLIP and ViLT are fused into a refined instruction for InstructCV, ensuring accurate and natural background transformation. The result is a realistic image with the person placed in a “library” environment.\n\n---\n\n#### B.

Justification\n\n- **BLIP (Image Captioning)**  \n  Provides a scene description for the original image. This helps InstructCV understand the spatial composition and objects that need to be preserved. [BLIP paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086)\n\n- **ViLT (Visual Q&A)**  \n  Analyzes image regions and responds to targeted queries like “Where is the person?” or “Is lighting from the left?”. This helps maintain spatial consistency. [ViLT paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03334)\n\n- **InstructCV (Image Editing via Instruction)**  \n  This is the core editor that replaces the background based on integrated semantic and spatial guidance. [InstructCV paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00390)\n\nThe synaptic architecture is crucial: each module brings complementary understanding—captioning, spatial analysis, and editing—and the final result is better than any single-module solution.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed breakdown of the user's request and a CNAPS-style workflow designed exclusively with the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a complex image editing task: replacing the existing background of a video conference screenshot with a new, semantically-defined background (a library).\n\nThis involves the following critical sub-goals:\n*   **Foreground/Background Segmentation:** Implicitly, the system must identify and separate the person (foreground) from their current surroundings (background).\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The foreground subject, including their posture, clothing, and features, must be preserved perfectly without distortion.\n*   **Background Generation:** The system must generate a new background that is contextually and visually consistent with the prompt \"a library.\"\n*   **Compositional Realism:** The final image must seamlessly blend the original foreground with the newly generated background, matching lighting, edges, and depth-of-field to create a believable composition.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network, incorporating a primary action path and a secondary verification branch that provides feedback, ensuring the final output meets the user's criteria.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes two inputs: the user's screenshot and their text request. The core of the workflow is the **`InstructCV`** model, which acts as the primary \"effector\" neuron, attempting the image edit in one step.\n\nHowever, to ensure accuracy and avoid a simple linear pipeline, the output from `InstructCV` does not go directly to the user. Instead, it is routed to a verification branch powered by the **`ViLT-VQA`** model. This \"auditor\" neuron inspects the candidate image by asking a critical question: \"Is the background a library?\".\n\nThe answer from the `ViLT-VQA` model triggers a conditional synapse. If the answer is \"yes,\" the workflow concludes, and the verified image is sent to the user. If the answer is \"no,\" it signifies a failure in the editing process, and the system can either report the failure or, in a more advanced loop, refine the prompt and try again. This branching and conditional logic is the essence of the CNAPS architecture.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Please try a different prompt.\"\n\n[END]\n```\n\n---\n\n#### **C. Justification and Design Rationale**\n\nThis CNAPS design is built on the specific capabilities of the provided models.\n\n1.  **Core Effector Module: `ImgTxt2Img-HuggingFace-alaa-lab-InstructCV`**\n    *   **Justification:** This model is the only one provided that can perform the central task. The user's request is a direct instruction for image editing (\"change the background\"), which perfectly aligns with the model's purpose.\n    *   **Paper Reference:** The **InstructCV paper** ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00390](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.00390)) describes a model trained to follow natural language instructions for image editing. Its architecture is explicitly designed to understand spatial and semantic commands like \"background,\" making it the ideal choice for this task. It handles the complex, implicit sub-goals of segmentation, generation, and composition in a single, powerful step.\n\n2.  **Verification Branch Module: `ImgTxt2Txt-HuggingFace-dandelin-vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa`**\n    *   **Justification:** A simple linear pipeline would blindly trust the output of `InstructCV`. A CNAPS architecture requires feedback and verification. The `ViLT-VQA` model serves as an independent auditor. By asking a targeted question (\"Is the background a library?\"), we can programmatically check if the primary module successfully fulfilled the semantic part of the request. This branching path is what makes the workflow a \"network.\"\n    *   **Paper Reference:** The **ViLT paper** ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03334](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03334)) details a Vision-and-Language Transformer that excels at tasks requiring a joint understanding of images and text, like Visual Question Answering. Its ability to accurately answer questions about image content makes it a reliable tool for verifying the output of another model, forming a crucial feedback loop in our synaptic workflow.\n\n3.  **Excluded Model: `Img2Txt-HuggingFace-Salesforce-blip-image-captioning-large`**\n    *   **Justification:** While the **BLIP** model ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12086)) is powerful for image captioning, it is not directly required to fulfill the user's request in this primary workflow. Its function (describing what is in an image) is superseded by the more direct verification capability of the VQA model. While it could be used in a more complex recovery loop (e.g., to generate a more detailed prompt if the first attempt fails), it is not essential for the core task, and this design prioritizes the most direct and effective path."

    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This is the winning response due to its superior and more creative workflow design. Instead of simple parallel processing, it proposes an \"effector-auditor\" model with a verification branch and a conditional decision gate.

The reasoning is exceptional, providing deep justification for each model choice (including why one model was excluded) and linking the design directly to the referenced papers. The entire response is clear, complete, and demonstrates a masterful understanding of the task."
