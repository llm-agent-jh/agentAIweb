    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance fashion photography by applying realistic retouching to photos of models wearing clothing, focusing on achieving natural skin tones, fabric textures, and lighting effects**. The goal is to create lifelike, professionally retouched images that maintain authenticity while improving visual appeal.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Skin tone enhancement and smoothing while preserving natural texture\n- Fabric detail preservation and realistic material rendering\n- Lighting correction and enhancement for natural illumination\n- Color grading for soft, realistic tones\n- Structure preservation of model poses and clothing fits\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **multi-branch enhancement network** where the input fashion photo is simultaneously processed through three specialized pathways, each optimized for different realistic rendering styles. The input image flows into three parallel branches using different Stable Diffusion models trained on realistic datasets. Each branch applies its unique approach to realistic enhancement - one focusing on general realism, another on mixed realistic styles, and the third on photographic realism. The outputs from all three branches are then intelligently merged using a weighted combination system that leverages the strengths of each model. The final output is a professionally retouched fashion photo with enhanced skin tones, fabric details, and natural lighting.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis **CNAPS-style synaptic architecture** is specifically designed to leverage the complementary strengths of three different realistic Stable Diffusion models. Rather than relying on a single model's interpretation of \"realistic,\" the parallel processing approach allows the system to:\n\n1. **Capture diverse realistic styles** - Each model brings different training biases and strengths in realistic rendering\n2. **Reduce single-model limitations** - If one model struggles with specific aspects (skin tones, fabric textures, lighting), others can compensate\n3. **Enable intelligent fusion** - The merger module can select the best features from each branch for optimal results\n\nThe three recommended models are all variants of Stable Diffusion V1 specifically trained or fine-tuned for realistic image generation, making them ideal for fashion photography enhancement where natural appearance is paramount. The synaptic branching structure mirrors how professional photo editors often try multiple enhancement approaches before selecting the best elements from each.",

    "llm_c": "Excellent. As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a sophisticated image retouching, not a re-generation. The goal is to enhance an existing photo of a model wearing clothes, applying a \"soft and realistic\" aesthetic that improves the perceived quality of the skin, fabric, and lighting to make them appear more lifelike.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The model's pose, the clothing's shape, and the overall composition must be perfectly maintained.\n*   **Texture Realism:** Enhance or add high-frequency details to skin and fabric to make them look tangible and realistic.\n*   **Style Application:** Apply a specific artistic style characterized by \"soft tones\" and natural, believable lighting.\n*   **Fidelity Improvement:** The final output should be a higher-fidelity version of the input, not a stylized cartoon or painting.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network where the initial input signal branches into parallel streams for structural analysis, which then converge to guide a core generation module, followed by a final refinement and quality-gating step.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a user's photo as its primary input. This input immediately branches into multiple parallel paths.\n\nFirst, the photo is sent to a **Structure Extraction Synapse** which uses multiple `ControlNet` pre-processors simultaneously. One path extracts skeletal pose (`OpenPose`), another extracts 3D depth information (`Depth`), and a third extracts hard edges (`Canny`). These three \"maps\" provide a comprehensive structural blueprint of the original image, ensuring the model's pose and the clothing's form are locked in.\n\nThese structural maps then converge as inputs to a **Base Generation Module**. This module uses a realism-focused diffusion model (e.g., `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic`) guided by the `ControlNet` maps. A carefully crafted text prompt describing the desired aesthetic (\"soft tones, realistic skin, natural light\") guides the *style* of the generation, while the ControlNet maps guide the *structure*. The original photo is used as an `image-to-image` base to further ground the result.\n\nThe output of this stage, a \"Base Retouched Image,\" is then passed to a sequential **Refinement Module**. This module uses the `Image-to-Image-SDXL-Refiner` to upscale the image and add high-frequency, lifelike details—perfect for enhancing skin pores and fabric weaves, directly addressing a key user requirement.\n\nFinally, the refined image is sent to a **Quality Gate Module**. This module uses `CLIP` to score the final image against the user's desired attributes (\"soft, realistic, lifelike photo\"). If the score meets a certain threshold, the image is considered a success and is output to the user. This conditional step ensures the final product aligns with the initial request.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style architecture is explicitly designed to meet the user's nuanced request by leveraging the unique capabilities of the provided models and papers.\n\n1.  **Structure Extraction & Preservation (`ControlNet-v1-1`)**: The user's primary need is to \"retouch,\" which implies preserving the original composition. A simple image-to-image pipeline would alter the model's pose and clothing. The **`ControlNet`** paper ([arXiv:2302.05543](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05543)) is the justification for the first critical step. It allows us to \"add conditional control\" to a diffusion model. By branching the input into `OpenPose`, `Depth`, and `Canny` pre-processors, we create a robust structural constraint that forces the generation to adhere strictly to the original photo's composition, pose, and form, thus satisfying the \"Structure Preservation\" sub-goal.\n\n2.  **Core Aesthetic Generation (`Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic`)**: The user specified a \"soft and realistic\" tone. A generic Stable Diffusion model might not achieve this specific aesthetic. We therefore select a fine-tuned model like **`majicMix-realistic`**, which is purpose-built for photorealism. It acts as the creative engine, interpreting the text prompt to apply the desired lighting and color style (\"Style Application\") while being constrained by the `ControlNet` inputs.\n\n3.  **High-Fidelity Detail Enhancement (`Image-to-Image-SDXL-Refiner`)**: The request for \"lifelike\" skin and fabric requires more than just good colors; it requires high-frequency texture detail. The **SDXL paper** ([arXiv:2307.01952](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01952)) introduces a two-stage pipeline with a base model followed by a refiner. Our workflow directly implements this concept. The **`SDXL-Refiner`** module is used specifically to \"improve the visual quality\" of the generated image by adding fine details, directly addressing the \"Texture Realism\" and \"Fidelity Improvement\" sub-goals. This sequential step is what elevates the output from a good stylization to a true, high-fidelity retouch.\n\n4.  **Semantic Quality"

    "gpt-4o": "This response demonstrates an exceptional understanding of the task requirements and employs a sophisticated CNAPS-style workflow. It effectively leverages the provided models and papers to justify each component of the workflow. The explanation is detailed, clear, and provides a strong rationale for all design choices, making it the most robust and comprehensive solution.",
    "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": "Excellent demonstration of true CNAPS-style synaptic architecture with parallel structure extraction branches that converge into a core generation module. Uses only provided models (ControlNet, SDXL-Refiner, CLIP, majicMix-realistic) with proper academic citations. The workflow shows genuine branching and merging with the structure extraction synapse feeding into controlled generation. Task interpretation is sophisticated, distinguishing retouching from regeneration. The quality gate module adds a proper conditional branch. Most complete and technically sound response.",
    "gemini-2.5-pro": "This is an outstanding response that is the clear winner. It correctly interprets the user's nuanced request for \"retouching\" while preserving structure. The proposed workflow is sophisticated, technically correct, and a perfect example of a CNAPS design, featuring parallel branching (`ControlNet`), convergence, sequential refinement (`SDXL-Refiner`), and a conditional gate (`CLIP`). The justification is exceptional, linking each design choice directly to the user's goals and the relevant academic papers, demonstrating a deep understanding of the technology."
