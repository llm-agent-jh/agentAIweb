    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to **enhance a blurry drone-captured rural landscape image by 8× super-resolution** to make distant houses and trees clearly visible. This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Resolution enhancement**: Upscaling the image by 8× factor while preserving fine details\n- **Structure preservation**: Maintaining the architectural integrity of houses and natural textures of trees/vegetation\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **hierarchical branching network** where the blurry input image flows through multiple SISR-DRN pathways simultaneously. The workflow branches into two parallel super-resolution streams: one using SISR-DRN-S-8x for speed and initial enhancement, and another using SISR-DRN-L-8x for maximum quality. A conditional routing mechanism determines whether to use direct 8× upscaling or a staged 4×→2× approach based on image quality metrics. The branches then merge through a weighted fusion module that combines the strengths of both approaches, producing a final 8× enhanced rural landscape.\n\n### B.

Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **SISR-DRN architecture's multi-scale capabilities** as described in the paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07018). The branching approach addresses the specific challenge of rural landscape enhancement by:\n\n1. **Exploiting model variants**: Using both SISR-DRN-S-8x for efficiency and SISR-DRN-L-8x for quality, as the paper demonstrates different performance characteristics between small and large models.\n\n2. **Staged vs. direct enhancement**: The conditional branching between direct 8× and staged 4×→2× approaches allows the system to adapt to different blur severities, which is crucial for drone imagery with varying focus quality.\n\n3. **Synapse-like fusion**: The weighted combination of multiple enhancement paths mimics biological neural networks, where multiple pathways contribute to final perception—essential for preserving both architectural details (houses) and natural textures (trees).\n\nThe workflow specifically addresses the user's need to \"clearly see houses and trees in the distance\" by using the DRN's dense residual connections to preserve fine structural details during the 8× upscaling process.",
    "llm_b": "---\n\n### 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a blurry drone-captured rural landscape by 8× super-resolution, making distant houses and trees clearly visible with accurate texture and structure restoration.\n\n**Sub-goals include:**\n- High-magnification enhancement (8× scale)\n- Restoration of building shapes and boundaries\n- Texture realism in trees, fields, and organic areas\n- Blur removal to improve visual clarity\n\n---\n\n### 2. CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe image is routed through two parallel super-resolution streams. One uses `SISR-DRN-S-8x` for fast, lightweight enhancement and the other uses `SISR-DRN-L-4x` followed by an interpolation module for a slower, more texture-preserving 8× path. A gating module evaluates blur severity and selects the appropriate strategy. After both branches run, their outputs are merged through a synaptic fusion mechanism that weights structural regions (like rooftops) from one and textures (like trees) from another.

Justification\n\n- **SISR-DRN-S-8x** provides efficient 8× super-resolution ideal for fast initial enhancement【489†source】.\n- **SISR-DRN-L-4x** improves fidelity of complex structures (trees, rooftops), and upsampling this 4× output to 8× allows detail preservation in texture-heavy regions【489†source】.\n- **SISR-DRN-L-8x** is used as a final polishing pass to unify tone, contrast, and detail sharpness【489†source】.\n- The **synaptic fusion** architecture mimics neuro-inspired perception: texture-rich and shape-rich pathways contribute independently and are integrated through confidence-aware merging.\n\nThis system ensures that both geometric clarity (e.g., house outlines) and textural realism (e.g., leaves, grass) are preserved across a large-scale 8× enhancement from low-quality aerial imagery.",
    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow designed to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform 8x super-resolution on a blurry, low-resolution drone photograph of a rural landscape. The primary goal is to enhance the image's perceptual quality so that distant, complex objects like houses and trees become clear and recognizable.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **High Magnification:** Achieve a specific 8x upscaling factor.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** Accurately restore the geometric shapes of man-made objects (e.g., sharp lines and corners of houses).\n*   **Texture Realism:** Generate plausible and naturalistic details for organic elements (e.g., foliage of trees, grass in fields).\n*   **Deblurring & Artifact Removal:** Mitigate the blurriness and potential compression artifacts common in drone footage.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed around a primary generation path and a parallel verification synapse that conditionally triggers a fallback path. This structure leverages the core principles of the provided DRN paper to ensure the final output is not only detailed but also consistent with the original input.\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the blurry, low-resolution (LR) drone image as input. This image is immediately sent down two parallel paths:\n\n1.  **Primary Generation Path:** The input image is processed by the most powerful model available for the task, **`SISR-DRN-L-8x`** (Large, 8x). This model is chosen for its high capacity to generate fine details and realistic textures, which is ideal for the complex scenery of trees and fields. This produces a `Candidate 8x Image`.\n\n2.  **Verification Synapse:** In parallel, a verification process begins. The `Candidate 8x Image` is downsampled back to its original resolution"
