    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to transform a rainy city alley photograph into a cinematic scene with neon lights and reflections. This involves **weather-based image enhancement** followed by **artistic style transfer** to achieve a cinematic aesthetic with neon lighting effects.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Remove or reduce rain artifacts while preserving scene structure\n- Apply cinematic styling with neon light characteristics\n- Maintain realistic reflections and atmospheric mood\n- Preserve architectural details of the alley\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system operates as a **dual-branch processing network** that handles both weather correction and artistic enhancement simultaneously, then merges the results for optimal cinematic output. \n\nThe input rainy alley photo flows into two parallel branches: a **weather correction branch** that removes rain artifacts while preserving reflective surfaces, and a **style enhancement branch** that applies cinematic neon styling. The weather-corrected image provides structural clarity, while the styled version contributes atmospheric and lighting effects. These branches merge through an intelligent blending process that preserves the best aspects of both—the clean structure from weather removal and the cinematic neon aesthetics from style transfer.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain**\n- **Input**: Original rainy alley photo (RGB image)\n- **Process**: Removes rain streaks, droplets, and weather artifacts while preserving wet surface reflections\n- **Output**: Clean alley image with maintained structural details and realistic wet pavement\n\n**Module 2: NST-fast-neural-style-rain-princess**\n- **Input**: Original rainy alley photo (RGB image)\n- **Process**: Applies artistic style transfer with emphasis on atmospheric lighting and color enhancement\n- **Output**: Stylized image with enhanced mood, color saturation, and artistic neon-like effects\n\n**Module 3: Intelligent Merge**\n- **Input**: Clean structure from DeRain + Stylized aesthetics from NST\n- **Process**: Blends images to preserve architectural clarity while maintaining cinematic color grading and lighting effects\n- **Output**: Final cinematic scene combining clean structure with neon aesthetic\n\n---\n\n## 3. Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS architecture leverages the **complementary strengths** of both weather removal and style transfer:\n\n- **WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain** ensures the final image maintains structural integrity and realistic surface properties, preventing the loss of important architectural details that might occur with style transfer alone.\n\n- **NST-fast-neural-style-rain-princess** provides the artistic transformation needed for cinematic appeal, with the \"rain princess\" style particularly suited for creating atmospheric, neon-lit urban scenes.\n\nThe **synaptic branching approach** prevents the sequential degradation that would occur in a linear pipeline, where weather removal might eliminate atmospheric elements needed for cinematic styling, or where style transfer might obscure important structural details. By processing both aspects in parallel and intelligently merging results, the system achieves both technical quality and artistic vision.",
    "llm_b": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to retouch a product photo with two main goals:\n- **Product Cleaning**: Make the product \"smooth and free of impurities.\"\n- **Background Beautification**: Make the background \"blurry under soft lighting.\"\n\nSub-goals include:\n- **Segmentation**: Accurate separation of foreground and background.\n- **Realistic Inpainting**: Fill in impurity regions with texture-aware synthesis.\n- **Soft Lighting & Blur**: Apply photo enhancement and depth-of-field effects.\n- **Final Composition**: Merge enhanced product with synthetic background seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n## 2.

    "llm_c": "As an expert AI scientist and architect, I will design a CNAPS-style multi-module workflow to fulfill the user's request, leveraging the provided models and research papers.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to transform a standard photograph of a rainy city alley into a highly stylized, atmospheric image. The goal is to retain the core structure of the alley and the wet, reflective surfaces from the rain, while introducing a new aesthetic defined by cinematic lighting and vibrant neon signs.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n*   **Structure Preservation:** The layout of the alley, buildings, and ground must remain recognizable.\n*   **Style Infusion:** A \"cinematic\" and \"neon\" style must be applied. The `NST-fast-neural-style-rain-princess` model is a perfect proxy for this, as its style is known for vibrant, reflective, and colorful night scenes.\n*   **Light & Reflection Realism:** The new neon lights must realistically cast color and light onto the wet surfaces (puddles, pavement).\n*   **Artifact Reduction:** The final image should be clean and free of common AI generation artifacts.\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input image through parallel, complementary paths before merging the results for a superior final output.\n\nThe process begins by taking the user's **Rainy City Alley Photo** and sending it to a pre-processing module to remove visual noise like rain streaks, creating a \"clean, wet\" base image. This base image then acts as a stimulus that fires across two primary synaptic branches:\n\n1.  **The Artistic Branch (A):** This path uses a fast neural style transfer model to rapidly apply a vibrant, painterly, neon-like aesthetic across the entire image. It's excellent for color and mood but may lack photorealism.\n2.  **The Semantic Branch (B):** This path uses a guided image synthesis model (SDEdit) which interprets the user's text prompt. It modifies the base image to more literally and structurally add \"neon lights\" and cinematic qualities, often with greater coherence and realism.\n\nThe outputs from these two branches—one artistically strong, the other semantically strong—are then sent to a **Merging Synapse**. This module intelligently blends them, taking the structural integrity and realistic lighting from the Semantic Branch and the superior color palette and mood from the Artistic Branch. This merge is guided by principles of photorealistic stylization.\n\nFinally, the merged image can pass through a conditional **Cleanup Module** that uses inpainting to fix any remaining artifacts, ensuring a high-quality final output.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification\n\n#### **Input: Rainy City Alley Photo**\n*   **Format:** Standard image file (e.g., JPEG, PNG).\n*   **Description:** The source image provided by the user, containing the core content (the alley) and the desired environmental state (rainy/wet).\n\n---\n\n#### **Module 1: DeRain Pre-processing**\n*   **Model Used:** `WeatherRemoval-CLAIO-DeRain`\n*   **Purpose:** To create a clean base for stylization. This model removes distracting visual elements like rain *streaks* and excessive water droplets, which can be misinterpreted by subsequent models as content or texture. The key is that it preserves the *effect* of rain (wet, reflective surfaces) while removing the noise"
