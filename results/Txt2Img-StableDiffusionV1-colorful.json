    "llm_a": "## 1. Core Task\n\nThe user wants to enhance a bouquet photograph by making the colors more vivid and ensuring each flower's colors stand out distinctly from one another. This involves color enhancement, saturation adjustment, and selective color boosting while maintaining photorealistic quality.\n\n**Sub-goals:**\n- Preserve original image structure and flower shapes\n- Enhance color saturation and vibrancy\n- Maintain photorealistic texture and lighting\n- Ensure individual flowers have distinct, non-competing colors\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes the input bouquet photo through a branching network where the original image is first enhanced for sharpness, then flows into two parallel branches: one for realistic color enhancement and another for vivid colorization. The realistic branch uses **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic** to maintain photorealism while enhancing colors, while the vivid branch uses **Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful** to create a highly saturated version. These outputs are then intelligently merged to achieve the optimal balance of vivid colors with realistic appearance. If the input image shows any blur, the **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** model preprocesses it to ensure sharp details before color enhancement.\n\n### B.

Detailed Module Specifications\n\n**Module 1: Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** (Conditional)\n- **Input:** Raw bouquet photo\n- **Output:** Deblurred image (if blur detected)\n- **Function:** Preprocesses image to ensure sharp details for optimal color enhancement\n- **Reference:** [ICCV 2021 - Rethinking Coarse-to-Fine Approach](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf)\n\n**Module 2: Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic** (Realistic Branch)\n- **Input:** Sharp base image + text prompt\n- **Prompt:** \"enhance colors of bouquet flowers, photorealistic, natural lighting\"\n- **Output:** Realistically enhanced bouquet with moderate color boost\n- **Function:** Maintains photorealism while enhancing colors\n\n**Module 3: Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful** (Vivid Branch)\n- **Input:** Sharp base image + text prompt  \n- **Prompt:** \"vibrant colorful bouquet with vivid saturated colors, each flower distinct\"\n- **Output:** Highly saturated, vivid version of bouquet\n- **Function:** Creates maximum color vibrancy and saturation\n\n**Module 4: Intelligent Color Blending & Merge**\n- **Input:** Realistic enhanced image + Vivid enhanced image\n- **Output:** Final balanced result\n- **Function:** Selectively combines the best aspects of both branches, using the realistic version as base structure and selectively applying vivid colors where appropriate\n\n---\n\n## 3. Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the strengths of each model:\n\n- **Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** ensures optimal input quality, as the ICCV 2021 paper demonstrates superior performance on real-world blur scenarios\n- **Dual-branch approach** allows for both photorealistic enhancement and maximum vibrancy, then intelligently combines them\n- **StableDiffusion variants** are specifically chosen for their different strengths: majicMix-realistic for maintaining natural appearance, and colorful for maximum saturation\n- **Synaptic merging** at the end ensures the final result balances user requirements (vivid colors) with photorealistic quality\n\nThis workflow addresses the user's specific need for \"vivid colors\" while ensuring \"each flower stands out more\" through the intelligent combination of realistic and vivid enhancement branches.",

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI scientist and architect, here is a detailed CNAPS-style workflow designed to fulfill the user's request using only the provided resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to perform a targeted color enhancement on a photograph of a flower bouquet. The primary goal is to increase color vibrancy and saturation to make each flower distinct, while the main sub-goal is to preserve the original composition, structure, and realistic textures of the flowers and leaves.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network with two main parallel branches: one for **Structure Preservation** and one for **Color Style Generation**. The outputs of these branches are then fused in a final step to produce the desired result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes the user's bouquet photo as its initial input. This input immediately triggers two parallel processing branches.\n\n1.  **The Content/Structure Branch:** The input photo is first sent to an optional but recommended pre-processing module, the `Deblur-MIMO-UNet`, to ensure maximum sharpness and detail in the final output. This branch is responsible for maintaining the original composition and structural integrity of the photo.\n\n2.  **The Style/Color Branch:** In parallel, a text prompt like \"a beautiful bouquet of flowers, extremely vivid and saturated colors, high detail\" is fed into the `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful` model. This model generates a new, completely synthetic image of a bouquet that does not match the user's photo in structure but serves as a perfect \"color palette\" or style reference, embodying the requested vividness.\n\n**Synaptic Merge:** The two branches converge at a **Color Transfer** node. This algorithmic process takes the deblurred original photo from the first branch and the vibrant, newly generated image from the second. It intelligently transfers the color characteristics (like the mean and standard deviation of colors in the Lab color space) from the generated image onto the original photo.\n\nThis fusion ensures that the final output retains the exact structure of the user's photo but is \"repainted\" with the vivid color profile of the AI-generated style reference.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Detailed Module Breakdown & Justification**\n\nThis CNAPS design is justified by the need to separate the preservation of **content** (the user's photo structure) from the generation of a new **style** (vivid colors), as we lack a direct image-editing model.\n\n1.  **Input Node: `User_Input_Photo`**\n    *   **Description:** The user's original photograph of the bouquet.\n    *   **Justification:** This is the starting point of the entire workflow, containing the core structure that must be preserved.\n\n2.  **Module 1: `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur`**\n    *   **Description:** This module takes the user's photo and applies a deblurring algorithm. It's a pre-processing step in the Structure Preservation branch.\n    *   **Justification:** The user wants the colors of \"each flower\" to stand out. Enhancing colors on a blurry image can lead to messy, indistinct results. By first sharpening the image, we ensure that the color enhancement will be applied to well-defined edges and textures. The **MIMO-UNet paper** (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf) describes a robust method for single-image deblurring that effectively handles various blur types, making it an ideal step to improve the foundational quality of the input before color manipulation.\n\n3.  **Module 2: `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful`**\n    *   **Description:** This module operates in a separate branch. It does not see the user's photo but instead takes a text prompt and generates a new image.\n    *   **Justification:** The user's request is \"vivid colors.\" The `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-colorful` model is explicitly named for this purpose. Since we cannot directly \"inject\" vividness into the original photo with the provided tools, we use this model to generate an *idealized example* of what \"vivid colors\" look like in the context of a bouquet. This generated image becomes our style source. The model `Txt2Img-StableDiffusionV1-majicMix-realistic` is not used because the goal is exaggerated color vibrancy, not realism.\n\n4.  **Synaptic Node: `Algorithmic Color Transfer`**\n    *   **Description:** This is not an AI model but a crucial algorithmic connector that merges the two branches. It uses a standard computer vision technique to transfer the color palette from the `Generated_Vivid_Image` to the `Deblurred_Input_Photo`.\n    *   **Justification:** This is the core of the CNAPS architecture for this task. It solves the central problem: how to apply the properties of a generated image to an existing one without a dedicated `Img2Img` model. By separating structure from color and recombining them here, we achieve the user's goal precisely. The `Deblurred_Input_Photo` provides the spatial arrangement and luminance (light/dark values), while the `Generated_Vivid_Image` provides the chrominance (color information).\n\n5.  **Output Node: `Final_Retouched_Image`**\n    *   **Description:** The final image, which has the exact composition and structure of the original photo but with the new, vibrant color palette.\n    *   **Justification:** This output directly fulfills the user's request by providing a retouched photo with vivid colors where each flower stands out, all while respecting the original's structure."
