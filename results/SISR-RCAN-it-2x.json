This involves two main sub-goals:\n- **Deblurring**: Remove motion blur or focus blur from the original images\n- **Super-resolution**: Upscale images by 2x while preserving and enhancing fine details like stitching patterns and fabric texture\n\n---\n\n## 2. CNAPS-style Workflow\n\n### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe system processes blurry bag photos through a **dual-pathway synapse network** where deblurring and super-resolution work in tandem. The input image branches into multiple deblurring pathways that specialize in different blur types (motion blur vs. defocus blur). These deblurred outputs are then intelligently merged based on quality metrics, and the best result feeds into a super-resolution module that specifically enhances textile details. A feedback loop allows the system to iteratively refine results if detail preservation metrics fall below threshold.\n\n### B.

Design Justification\n\nThis CNAPS design leverages the **complementary strengths** of different deblurring approaches from the MSSNet and MIMO-UNet papers:\n\n- **MSSNet-RealBlurR/J** (https://cg.postech.ac.kr/Research/MSSNet/MSSNet.pdf): These models use multi-scale feature extraction specifically trained on real-world blur scenarios, making them ideal for the varied blur types in product photography.\n\n- **MIMO-UNet-RealBlur** (https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/papers/Cho_Rethinking_Coarse-To-Fine_Approach_in_Single_Image_Deblurring_ICCV_2021_paper.pdf): This model's multi-input multi-output architecture allows it to handle complex blur patterns that might be missed by single-path approaches.\n\nThe **synapse-like branching** ensures robustness—if one deblurring path fails on a particular blur type, the other branches can compensate. The quality assessment merger prevents poor results from propagating downstream, while the feedback loop enables iterative refinement for challenging cases where textile detail preservation is critical.",

CNAPS-style Synaptic Workflow\n\n#### A. High-Level Overview\n\nThe blurry bag image is simultaneously routed into three deblurring branches, each specialized for a different type of real-world blur. `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR` focuses on motion blur, `Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ` handles general compression or defocus blur, and `Deblur-MIMO-UNet-RealBlur` captures multi-scale degradation. These three outputs are passed to a Quality Assessor module that selects the sharpest candidate based on stitching and texture fidelity.

    "llm_c": "Of course. As an expert AI architect, I will design a CNAPS-style workflow to address the user's request using only the provided models and papers.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Core Task**\n\nThe user wants to enhance blurry photos of a bag to make fine details, specifically the **sewing lines and material texture**, sharp and clearly visible for online viewing.\n\nThe primary sub-goals to achieve this are:\n*   **Image Deblurring:** To remove the motion or focus blur that is obscuring details.\n*   **Texture & Detail Restoration:** To realistically reconstruct high-frequency details like fabric weave and thread patterns.\n*   **Structure Preservation:** To ensure the overall shape and structure of the bag remain free of artifacts or distortion.\n\nWhile the user requested a 2x enlargement, the provided models are specialists in deblurring, not super-resolution. The workflow will therefore focus on achieving the user's core goal—clarity—by maximizing detail restoration at the original resolution, which is the most effective approach with the available tools.\n\n---\n\n### **2. CNAPS-style Workflow**\n\nThis workflow is designed as a synaptic network that processes the input in parallel through specialized branches and then intelligently selects the optimal result.\n\n---\n\n#### **A. High-Level Overview**\n\nThe system takes a single blurry photograph of the bag as its input. This input is immediately broadcast to three parallel processing branches, treating each as a specialized neuron firing simultaneously.\n\n*   **Branch 1** uses the **MIMO-UNet** model. This model's unique coarse-to-fine architecture is excellent at handling a wide range of blur types and restoring overall image structure.\n*   **Branch 2** and **Branch 3** use the **MSSNet** model, but with different specializations. One is trained on the RealBlur-R dataset (`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurR`) and the other on RealBlur-J (`Deblur-MSSNet-RealBlurJ`). These datasets capture different kinds of real-world blur (e.g., from camera shake vs. object motion). Running them in parallel makes the system robust to the specific, unknown type of blur in the user's photo.\n\nEach of these three branches independently generates a candidate deblurred image. These three candidates then converge at a **Quality Assessor** module. This module acts as a synapse, evaluating the outputs based on key metrics like sharpness, texture coherence, and the absence of artifacts. It then selects the single best image that most successfully reveals the bag's sewing lines and material texture.\n\nThe final output is this single, highest-quality deblurred photograph.\n\n---\n\n#### **B.

Justification of Design**\n\nThis CNAPS-style design is superior to a simple linear pipeline because real-world blur is complex and unpredictable. By leveraging multiple specialized models in parallel, we increase the probability of a high-quality restoration.\n\n1.  **Parallel Deblurring for Robustness**:\n    *   The **MIMO-UNet** model (Cho et al., 2021) introduces a \"rethinking of the coarse-to-fine approach.\" Its multi-scale architecture is fundamentally different from MSSNet, potentially giving it an edge on certain types of blur and preserving global structure more effectively.\n    *   The **MSSNet** model (Kim et al., 2021) uses a \"multi-stage splitting network\" which excels at progressively restoring details. Using both `RealBlurR` and `RealBlurJ` versions is a critical branching decision. As the paper notes, these datasets contain different real-world blur kernels. One model might be superior at removing blur from camera shake (`RealBlur-R`) while the other is better at handling combined camera and object motion (`RealBlur-J`). By running both, we hedge against the unknown source of blur in the user's photo.\n\n2.  **Synaptic Selection (Quality Assessor)**:\n    *   A simple pipeline would force a single model choice upfront. The CNAPS workflow avoids this by generating multiple hypotheses (Candidates A, B, and C).\n    *   The **Quality Assessor** module acts as the crucial decision-making synapse. It synthesizes the results from the parallel branches and makes an informed choice. This ensures the final output is not just an arbitrary result, but the *best possible result* achievable"
